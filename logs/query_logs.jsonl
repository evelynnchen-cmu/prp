Short sleep duration is associated with increased risks of depression, as it may lead to daytime fatigue and promote the onset of depressive symptoms (li2023relationship, li2023relationship_chunk_019). Specifically, studies have shown that short sleep duration can increase the incidence of depression across various age groups, including adolescents (Gangwisch et al., 2010), adults (Watson et al., 2014), and older adults (Putilov, 2013). \n\nConversely, long sleep duration is also linked to a higher risk of depression, potentially due to factors such as low physical activity, which can decrease neurotransmitter levels (like dopamine and serotonin) and increase the risk of depressive symptoms (li2023relationship, li2023relationship_chunk_019). For instance, a Chinese study found that older individuals sleeping more than 10 hours per night had the highest risk of depression (Jiang et al., 2020) (li2023relationship, li2023relationship_chunk_005). \n\nMoreover, a U-shaped relationship has been identified, indicating that both short and long sleep durations are associated with increased depression risk (Kripke et al., 2011) (li2023relationship, li2023relationship_chunk_005). This relationship is further supported by findings from a nationally representative sample in the United States, which showed that lower sleep regularity and reduced subjective night sleep were significantly associated with higher depression severity (maki2025sleep, maki2025sleep_chunk_001).\n\nIn summary, both insufficient and excessive sleep duration are correlated with increased depression risk, highlighting the importance of maintaining optimal sleep patterns for mental health.

Specifically, this group exhibits a 14.1 percentage-point increase in depression incidence compared to those who sleep the recommended amount (approximately 7-8 hours) (fasokun2026associations, fasokun2026associations_chunk_022). This relationship is supported by various studies indicating that short sleep duration can increase the incidence of depression across different age groups, including adolescents, adults, and older adults (li2023relationship, li2023relationship_chunk_005).\n\n2. **Long Sleep Duration**: Conversely, sleeping for an extended duration (9 hours or more) is also linked to a higher likelihood of depression, with a 12.9 percentage-point increase in depression incidence compared to the recommended sleep duration (fasokun2026associations, fasokun2026associations_chunk_022). Research indicates that long sleep duration can be correlated with low physical activity, which may further exacerbate the risk of depression due to decreased neurotransmitter levels (li2023relationship, li2023relationship_chunk_019).\n\n3. **Bidirectional Relationship**: The relationship between sleep duration and depression is complex and bidirectional. While extreme sleep times can be a symptom of depression, poor sleep is also recognized as a risk factor for developing depressive symptoms (li2023relationship, li2023relationship_chunk_005). \n\n4. **Non-linear Relationship**: A U-shaped relationship has been observed, where both short and long sleep durations are associated with increased depression risk, indicating that there is an optimal range of sleep duration for mental health (li2023relationship, li2023relationship_chunk_005).\n\n5. **Gender Differences**: Evidence suggests that women may be more affected by sleep duration in relation to depression, indicating that gender could be a risk factor (li2023relationship, li2023relationship_chunk_019).\n\nIn summary, both insufficient and excessive sleep duration are associated with higher risks of depression, highlighting the importance of maintaining an optimal sleep duration for mental health.
