Although sleep and depression relationships are well-studied, the relative impact of different sleep factors remains unclear. As patient-specific factors and health behaviors influence sleep and mental health, we investigated associations between sleep and depression severity considering such factors in a United States sample of adults. Methods: Two cycles (20112012, 20132014) from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey were studied. Objective sleep duration (day and night), and the sleep regularity index (SRI) were calculated from physical activity monitors worn for seven days. Complex survey procedures with four-year weights were used, and backward selection was used to test relevant variables in the fully adjusted regression model. Results: Among participants (n = 7297), we found associations between sleep-associated variables and SRI, with increased daytime sleep being the strongest correlate of decreased SRI. In the fully adjusted model, lower SRI scores and reduced subjective night sleep remained significantly associated with depression. Sex was an addi tional independent predictor, with females exhibiting higher depression scores, and a significant sex  SRI interaction revealed that the inverse relationship between SRI and depressive symptoms was stronger in females than in males. Health behaviors, including active tobacco and cannabis use, were also associated with increased depression severity in the adjusted model. Conclusions: Daytime sleep may serve as an SRI proxy, although additional cohorts should confirm relationships. Higher depression severity was associated with different sleep components, emphasizing the importance of sleep hygiene in mental health. Behaviors like current smoking and cannabis use were also associated with increased depression. Research exploring the temporality and interactions between these factors may assist in non- pharmacologic depression treatment. 1. Background Healthy sleep is a key determinant of overall health and disease prevention, with evidence supporting the role of sleep in maintaining physiological and psychological homeostasis (Li et al., 202", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 0, "end_char": 2831, "similarity_score": 0.7290268540382385}, {"chunk_id": "fasokun2026associations_chunk_022", "source_id": "fasokun2026associations", "text": " hours) served as the reference group for comparison. Participants with short sleep duration (5 hours) had a significantly higher probability of depression, with an ATE coefficient of 0.141 (Std. Err. = 0.002, z = 90.20, p < 0.001; 95% CI: 0.1380.144). This indicates a 14.1 percentage-point increase in depression incidence compared to individuals who sleep the recommended number of hours. Similarly, long sleep duration (9 hours) was also associated with a significantly elevated likelihood of depression, with an ATE coefficient of 0.129 (Std. Err. = 0.002, z = 65.99, p < 0.001; 95% CI: 0.1250.133), representing a 12.9 percentage-point increase compared to the recommended group. Individuals with recommended sleep had a baseline depression probability of 39.5% (Coef. = 0.395, Std. Err. = 0.0001, z = 581.66, p < 0.001; 95% CI: 0.3940.397), which was markedly lower than that of both short and long sleepers. Table 2.

Health behaviors and socioeconomic characteristics are increasingly recognized as pivotal factors that influence both sleep quality and mental health (Grandner et al., 2015). These factors, which include household income, employment status, physical activity, and diet (among others), profoundly shape individual sleep patterns and may exacerbate or mitigate mental health symptoms. Despite understanding the important role of sleep duration in influencing mental health char acteristics (Zhang et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024; Nielson et al., 2023), further research is needed to explore how environmental, behavioral, and other sleep-related factors impact self-reported mental health. Un derstanding these interactions is crucial for identifying modifiable health behaviors that may present valuable opportunities for developing targeted interventions to improve depressive symptom severity. Eluci dating such mechanisms will enable us to understand which components of sleep phenotype contribute to depression and provide us with a comprehensive overview of the influence of sleep health on mental health. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate associations between sleep characteristics (i.e., regularity, duration) and self-reported depression severity considering relevant demographic, health behavior and socioeconomic characteristics in a nationally representative U.S. Sample using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 20112014. 2. Methods 2.1. Study sample The NHANES is a cross-sectional, nationally representative health and nutrition survey designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the U.S. through a combination of interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory tests (Chen et al., 2018). The NHANES survey is administered by the National Center for Health Sta tistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the survey uses a complex, multistage probability sampling design to ensure that its data are representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. popu lation (Johnson et al., 2013). This study includes two cycles of NHANES data (20112012, 20132014), which are the two NHANES cycles where physical activity monitors were applied and actigraphy data was collected for objective sleep assessment (National Center for Health Statistics, 2012; National Center for Health Statistics, 2014a). Of the 15, 179 participants included in these two NHANES cycles, subjects 18 years of age and older with self-reported depression severity instrument data, and no psychotropic medication use were considered for analysis.

More importantly, few meta- analyses focused on cohort studies have been carried out to explore quantitative length of sleep duration and their impact on the risk of depression. The study aims to analyze the relationship between night-sleep duration and the risk of depression through a doseresponse meta- analysis based on cohort and casecontrol studies that quantitatively describe how night-sleep time inuences the risk of depression in a bid to offer some clues to prevention for depression. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Search strategy First, we systematically searched eligible studies, including cohort and casecontrol studies, in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the China Network Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI; 19792022), the Chinese VIP Information (19892022), and the Wan Fang database (19952022) from inception to 31 July 2022, limiting language to English and Chinese. Second, a series of topic- related editorials, perspectives, methodology, and comments were also reviewed for potentially useful information. Third, other relevant studies were manually investigated as the supplement literature. Our search terms encompassed sleep duration, sleep time, sleep disorders, night sleep, sleepiness, sleep pattern, and depression. Details of the systematic search are shown in Supplementary Table S1. 2.2 Selected criteria The following original studies were considered for this meta- analysis: 1) middle-aged or older people as subjects; 2) epidemiological studies based on cohort population, casecontrol, and cross-sectional studies; 3) sleep duration with more than three exposure categories; 4) depression regarded as the endpoint for evaluation; 5) study providing odds ratio (OR), risk ratio (RR), or hazard ratio (HR) with 95% condence intervals (CIs), or other sufcient data to estimate these values. The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) studies without full text available (conference proceedings) and review articles; 2) studies missing vital data for meta-analysis (e.g., number of cases, follow-up duration, RR/OR/HR value, and their 95% CIs) and inaccessible to contact with authors via email or telephone. 2.3 Data extraction After two rounds of literature screening (titleabstract and full- text review) by two authors (Li XL and Zhang XY) independently in accord with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, irrelevant studies were removed. Any inconsistencies during this process were resolved by the third author (Zhu WT) through discussion.

Since the number of participants who selected the rst option was small, this option was combined with the second one. Thus, sleep quality was assessed on a 4-point scale. For sleep quantity, the participants were asked How many hours do you usually sleep a day? with the following four options: less than 4 h, 46 h, 68 h, and 8 h or more. The study also assessed the sleep score, reecting both sleep quantity and sleep quality, against the development of coronary heart disease. Short sleep duration and poor sleep quality were found to be associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Participants who had lower sleep scores also showed a higher risk of the disease. The authors concluded that both sleep quantity and sleep quality should be considered for developing strategies for improving sleep, with the aim of preventing coronary heart disease. Moore et al. found that the effects on health of sleep quality, assessed by 5-point scale (1 = poor and 5 = excellent; mean value of 3.1 with a standard deviation of 1.2), were greater than the effects of sleep quantity, even after adjusting for other individual characteristics [25]. They also showed that the impact of sleep quality on physical health increased as the subjects slept for shorter durations. Yang et al. [26] investigated the association between sleep measures (quantity and quality) and BMI among 10,007 adults living in the Philadelphia area. Sleep quality was assessed by asking about the participants sleep quality on a 5-point scale, with 1 being restless and 5 being restful. The question on sleep duration was How many hours of sleep do you get at night?. The overall sleep quality score was 3.61, with a standard deviation of 1.29. On average, men reported better sleep quality than women. Fifty-ve per cent of the women and 53% of the men slept for at least 7 h every night; 27% slept for between 6 and 7 h, and 20% slept for less than 5 h. The study found that better sleep quality was related to lower BMI in women, while men who slept for less than 5 h had a higher BMI than those who slept for 7 h or more. In order to reduce BMI, it may be useful to help men to increase their sleep duration and women to improve their sleep quality.

The study from Windred et al. [6] adds to a growing body of evidence that regularity of nightly sleep is an independent correlate of future morbidity and mortal- ity that confers equal, if not greater, predictive value than sleep duration. While there is unequivocal evidence for a critical role of sleep duration in cardiometabolic health [8], irregular sleep, also a directly modifiable lifestyle behavior, is now strongly linked with both cardiometabolic costs [2] and mortality [6]. This high- lights the need to address multiple sleep behaviors to reap the greatest cardiometabolic health benefits. The study by Windred et al. also highlights areas for future research. As noted by the authors, there is a lack of diversity among UK Biobank participants, bringing into question the broader generalizability of findings. Therefore, it will be of par- ticular importance to replicate these findings among racially and ethnically diverse samples given established sleep health dispar- ities and their emerging contribution to broader health inequi- ties [10]. Another question stemming from this investigation is whether SRI is the most useful tool to capture interdaily regular- ity in sleep patterns. While the SRI provides a unique, valid, and reliable measure of sleep regularity that confers predictive value for health outcomes, the means of deriving this measure is com- plex and requires granular data on sleep and activity. In contrast, other measures of sleep variability, such as the intra-individual standard deviation (SD) of sleep onset timing, can be computed  The Author(s) 2023.

This study aimed to explore this association using data from a large, nationally representative sample of US adults. Methods: Data from 13,476 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 20072012 were analyzed. Weighted robust Poisson regression models were employed to assess the relationship between sleep duration and anxiety, with additional subgroup analyses conducted to explore variations across different demographic groups. Results: Among participants, 25.8% exhibited symptoms of anxiety. Compared to normal sleep duration (79 hours), very short sleep durations (<5 hours) and short sleep durations (5 to <7 hours) were significantly linked to higher anxiety risks, with adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 1.40 (95% CI [1.231.59]) and 1.17 (95% CI [1.091.25]), respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed that shorter sleep durations were more strongly associated with anxiety in males, older adults, racial minorities, and married individuals compared to their counterparts.

Notably, long sleep duration (9 hours) showed no significant overall association with anxiety (IRR = 1.11 [0.951.29]); however, in specific subgroups such as non-married individuals and younger adults, it was linked to an increased risk of anxiety. Conclusion: Short sleep duration is associated with an increased risk of anxiety, with the strength of this association differing notably across demographic subgroups. Long sleep duration is associated with higher anxiety risk exclusively in specific groups, including non-married individuals and younger adults. Further research is needed to uncover the mechanisms underlying these associations. Keywords: sleep duration, anxiety, NHANES, mental health, cross-sectional study Introduction Anxiety disorders, affecting approximately 34% of the US population, are among the most prevalent mental health issues worldwide.1 These disorders not only cause significant distress and functional impairment but also frequently co-occur with other mental health conditions and a range of physiological disorders, including neurological, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal diseases.26 Given their widespread prevalence and profound impact, it is crucial to investigate the underlying mechanisms of anxiety disorders to develop targeted prevention and intervention strategies. Sleep is fundamental for cognitive and emotional well-being,7 with disturbances in sleep closely linked to mental health disorders, particularly anxiety.8,9 Recent research has increasingly focused on the relationship between sleep duration and anxiety. A meta-analysis revealed that individuals with anxiety disorders often experience reduced total sleep time.10 Similarly, a cross-sectional survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic indicated that non- hospitalized individuals who slept seven or more hours per night exhibited a significantly lower anxiety incidence than those who slept less than seven hours.11 Additionally, a cohort study in Korea found that sleeping between seven to nine hours, as opposed to six hours per day, effectively reduced the likelihood of future anxiety symptoms.12 Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2025:18 11551167 1155  2025 Wang et al.

In addition, future studies could explore differences in sleep patterns between workdays and weekends, as such variations may offer further insight into the relationship between sleep duration and anxiety, and help inform more targeted intervention strategies. Conclusions Findings from this study suggest a potential association between short sleep duration and an increased risk of anxiety symptoms, particularly among males, older adults, racial minorities, and married individuals. In contrast, long sleep duration may be linked to increased anxiety risk only in certain populations, such as younger adults and non-married individuals. These associations should be interpreted with caution due to limitations in the measurement of sleep and anxiety. Further investigation is needed to unravel the mechanisms underlying these associations and inform tailored interventions design.

Although prior studies have examined the association between sleep duration and anxiety, findings have been inconsistent. More importantly, few have systematically investigated how this relationship varies across sociodemo graphic subgroups using nationally representative data from the United States. This study utilizes data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a robust and nationally representative dataset renowned for its rigorous sampling methodology, which ensures that the findings can be generalized to the broader US population. The study aims to achieve two primary objectives: first, to explore the association between sleep duration and anxiety within a representative population, and second, to examine how this relationship varies across different demographic subgroups. Understanding these relationships is essential for deepening our knowledge of the complex interplay between sleep and anxiety and for guiding targeted public health interventions.

For instance, it relies on limited population groups, which significantly restricts the generalizability of its findings to more diverse populations,17 such as the US population examined in the current study. Therefore, the association between short sleep duration and anxiety warrants further investigation across culturally and demographically diverse populations. Regarding longer sleep duration, some studies suggest that sleep exceeding nine hours does not increase the risk of anxiety.12 Likewise, the above Mendelian randomization study has not supported a causal relationship between extended sleep duration and anxiety.16 Nevertheless, other research has found that, compared to seven hours or seven to nine hours of sleep, longer sleep duration (10 hours) is significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety.1820 Therefore, the relationship between long sleep duration and anxiety also warrants further exploration.

Methods: Baseline data from a lifestyle intervention trial with young adults (ages 1835 years) with SMI included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), mental health, physical health, and health behavior outcomes. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression were used in analyses. Results: Of 150 participants, 76% were categorized with poor sleep quality. Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with sleep quality ( = .438, p < .001); however, no association was found with physical health and health behaviors. Conclusions: Young adults with SMI enrolled in lifestyle interventions may benefit from treatment that addresses sleep as part of a comprehensive approach to health promotion with attention to the role of depressive symptoms in sleep quality.

Health behaviors and socioeconomic characteristics are increasingly recognized as pivotal factors that influence both sleep quality and mental health (Grandner et al., 2015). These factors, which include household income, employment status, physical activity, and diet (among others), profoundly shape individual sleep patterns and may exacerbate or mitigate mental health symptoms. Despite understanding the important role of sleep duration in influencing mental health char acteristics (Zhang et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024; Nielson et al., 2023), further research is needed to explore how environmental, behavioral, and other sleep-related factors impact self-reported mental health. Un derstanding these interactions is crucial for identifying modifiable health behaviors that may present valuable opportunities for developing targeted interventions to improve depressive symptom severity. Eluci dating such mechanisms will enable us to understand which components of sleep phenotype contribute to depression and provide us with a comprehensive overview of the influence of sleep health on mental health. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate associations between sleep characteristics (i.e., regularity, duration) and self-reported depression severity considering relevant demographic, health behavior and socioeconomic characteristics in a nationally representative U.S. Sample using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 20112014. 2. Methods 2.1. Study sample The NHANES is a cross-sectional, nationally representative health and nutrition survey designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the U.S. through a combination of interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory tests (Chen et al., 2018). The NHANES survey is administered by the National Center for Health Sta tistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the survey uses a complex, multistage probability sampling design to ensure that its data are representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. popu lation (Johnson et al., 2013). This study includes two cycles of NHANES data (20112012, 20132014), which are the two NHANES cycles where physical activity monitors were applied and actigraphy data was collected for objective sleep assessment (National Center for Health Statistics, 2012; National Center for Health Statistics, 2014a). Of the 15, 179 participants included in these two NHANES cycles, subjects 18 years of age and older with self-reported depression severity instrument data, and no psychotropic medication use were considered for analysis.

Research using objective measures of sleep structure or quality may find relationships between sleep and physical health and health behaviors in this population. Discrepancies between subjective and objective measures of sleep have been shown in psychiatric populations (Krishnamurthy et al., 2018; Werner et al., 2016). While the primary interest of our study was patient reported outcome measures of sleep quality, future longitudinal research could include both subjective and objective measures of sleep to rigorously evaluate its relationship with changes in health behaviors and mental health and physical health outcomes. Limitations of the study also include the cross sectional design and select sample. The cross sectional design does not allow for determining the direction of the relationship between depression and sleep quality. While our sample of young adults with SMI who were motivated to enroll in a lifestyle intervention to lose weight and improve their fitness provides insight into sleep quality in this group, the sample also potentially limits generalizability of the findings to young adults with SMI in general. CONCLUSION Poor sleep quality is common among young adults with SMI who enrolled in a lifestyle intervention to lose weight and improve fitness. Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with poor sleep quality in this transdiagnostic sample of young adults with serious mental illness while physical health and health behaviors were not associated with sleep. Promoting good sleep as part of comprehensive lifestyle intervention for young adults with SMI and addressing the role of depressive symptoms in sleep quality should be considered in future research in this group.

Though tradi tionally underexplored, prolonged sleep has increasingly been implicated in poor health outcomes, potentially reflecting underlying undiagnosed health conditions or behavioral and social determinants of health [5557]. For example, those in the  9-hour group had a 12.9% increase in depression incidence and reported worse mental and physical health than the 68-hour group, albeit with slightly lower burden than short sleepers. This U-shaped association highlights that both insufficient and excessive sleep are detrimental to health. Importantly, we accounted for the potential influence of the COVID-19 pandemic by including survey year and state fixed effects in our analysis. The pandemic period did not significantly modify the observed associations, suggesting that the link between sleep duration and health outcomes persisted regardless of broader societal disruptions.

Future research should employ longitudinal and experimental designs to clarify causality and explore potential biologi cal and behavioral mechanisms underlying the associations observed. Such work may also identify vulnerable subpopula tions who would benefit most from targeted sleep health interventions. Conclusion This study provides robust evidence that both short (5 hours) and long (9 hours) sleep durations are significantly asso ciated with adverse health outcomes compared to the recommended 68 hours of sleep. Individuals in the short and long sleep categories exhibited a higher incidence of depression, more days of poor mental and physical health, and worse overall self-rated general health. These findings reinforce the importance of maintaining optimal sleep duration as a key determinant of population mental and physical well-being. Public health efforts should prioritize strategies to promote sleep health, identify at-risk individuals, and address underlying factors contributing to inadequate or excessive sleep. Tailored interventions, health education campaigns, and clinical screening for sleep patterns may collectively improve individual outcomes and reduce the burden of sleep-related health disparities across the United States.

As a result, while it appears that sleep restriction does impair cognition, it is not clear what cognitive domains are most affected (e.g. memory vs. problem-solving), and whether these impairments manifest from the type of chronic sleep restriction that many people are experiencing in everyday life. Previous cross-sectional studies of large survey-type data- sets have shown that some simple measures of cognition, like performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination, are related to sleep duration [1115]: people who report having an abnormal amount of sleep (e.g. too little or too much sleep) consistently performed worse on such tests. However, with one exception [15] these reports focused on global measures of cognitive per- formance [1214], and/or specific tests sensitive to the onset of Alzheimers disease [11, 13], giving a narrow view of cognitive performance. Also, despite their large samples, none of these studies looked at whether the relationship between sleep dura- tion and cognition depended on demographic variables, like age. After all, it is commonly observed that nightly sleep decreases as we get older [16], and mounting evidence suggests that sleep is important for preserving cognitive function in older adults [17]. Current recommendations [18] suggest that people 65 years and older may need slightly less sleep than younger adults, but these guidelines are based on many factors other than just cognition. In the current study, we leveraged the power of the Internet to investigate the relationship between everyday sleep and cog- nition in more than 10 000 individuals drawn from all walks of life, age groups, and backgrounds. Volunteers completed the Cambridge Brain Sciences (CBS) online 12-test battery, which taps a broad range of cognitive abilities, such as aspects of inhibition, selective attention, reasoning, verbal short-term memory, spatial working memory, planning, visuospatial work- ing memory, and cognitive flexibility. The tests have been vali- dated in patients with anatomically-specific brain lesions [19, 20], in neurodegenerative populations [21, 22], in pharmaco- logical intervention studies [23, 24], and their neural correlates have been thoroughly described using functional neuroimaging [2528", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 5665, "end_char": 8219, "similarity_score": 0.7311134338378906}, {"chunk_id": "wild2018dissociable_chunk_021", "source_id": "wild2018dissociable", "text": " sake) reasoning abilities. The location of the maximum occurred at a delta of 1.30 hours (95% CI = 0.235 to 7.377) and 1.18 hours (95% CI = 0.2492.762) for reasoning and overall scores, respec- tively. This implies that sleeping around 1.18 hours more than usual was associated with best overall cognitive performance; however, sleeping less than the usual amount, or sleeping more than 2.76 hours more than usual (i.e. the upper 95% CI or the delta maximum), was associated with decreasing performance. Given that the average amount of typical sleep for our sample was 6.41 hours, and that the optimal amount of sleep for overall cognitive performance was found to be between 7.027.91 hours, this finding suggests that cognitive performance is better given a night of sleep that is closer to the optimal amount than usual. In other words, sleeping closer to 7 to 8 hours on a given night was associated with better overall cognition. Figure 2.

Future work could investigate how cognition varies as a function of sleep duration, wake time, and the amount of time between waking and testing. The wide age range of our sample allowed us to test whether the relationship between reported sleep duration and cognitive performance varied as a function of age, but we found no evi- dence for such an interaction. In fact, the data were strongly in favor of the null hypothesisthat the shape and location of the inverted-U association is constant across the lifespan. Put simply, the amount of sleep that results in optimal cognitive performance (78 hours), and the impact of deviating from this amount, was the same for everyoneregardless of age. Somewhat counter-intui- tively, this implies that older adults who slept more or less than the optimal amount were impacted no more than younger adults who had non-optimal sleep. If sleep is especially important for staving off dementia and age-related cognitive decline [17], then one might predict that a lack of sleep (or too much sleep) would be associated with more pronounced cognitive impairment in the elderly than in younger adults. Nonetheless, given that 78 hours of sleep was associated with optimal cognition for all ages and that increasing age was associated with less sleep, older populations in general would likely benefit from more sleep. The age-invariant relationship between sleep and cognition that we observed is consistent with another recent large-scale study [43], that found a negative association between sleep and general cog- nitive performance, but little evidence that the effect depended on age. As far as we know, these are the only two reports that examine the interaction of sleep, cognition, and age within the same study. By far, most studies of the relationship between sleep duration and cognition focus on middle-aged to older popula- tions [8, 12, 13, 15, 37, 44], yet our finding that 78 hours of sleep was associated with optimal cognitive performance is consistent with all of them. One caveat to this conclusion is that our analysis may not have been sensitive to a difference in more senior par- ticipants because: (1) the number of volunteers over the age of 70 was low (N = 269) and (2) the interaction model assumed that the parameters of the quadratic curve would vary smoothly with age, whereas there could be a more sudden change in this relation- ship during early and later stages of life", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 43132, "end_char": 45681, "similarity_score": 0.7035114765167236}], "answer": "The optimal sleep duration for cognitive performance, based on the provided evidence, is identified as being between 7.0 to 8.0 hours per night. This conclusion is supported by the following claims and data:\n\n1. **Optimal Sleep Duration**: The study found that sleeping around 1.18 hours more than usual was associated with the best overall cognitive performance. The average amount of typical sleep reported by participants was 6.41 hours, and the optimal amount for cognitive performance was identified as between 7.0 to 7.91 hours (wild2018dissociable, wild2018dissociable_chunk_021).\n\n2. **Cognitive Performance and Sleep Duration**: There is a U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and cognitive performance. Sleeping less than the usual amount or more than 2.76 hours above the usual amount was associated with decreased cognitive performance. This indicates that both insufficient and excessive sleep can impair cognitive abilities (wild2018dissociable, wild2018dissociable_chunk_021).\n\n3. **Age and Sleep Duration**: The relationship between sleep duration and cognitive performance was found to be consistent across different age groups. The optimal amount of sleep (7-8 hours) was associated with optimal cognitive performance regardless of age, suggesting that deviations from this amount affect cognitive performance similarly across the lifespan (wild2018dissociable, wild2018dissociable_chunk_027).\n\n4. **Statistical Evidence**: The study utilized a large sample size of over 10,000 individuals and employed a comprehensive cognitive test battery. The findings indicate significant relationships between self-reported typical sleep duration and cognitive scores, particularly in reasoning and overall cognitive ability (wild2018dissociable, wild2018dissociable_chunk_004; wild2018dissociable, wild2018dissociable_chunk_004).\n\nIn summary, the evidence suggests that optimal sleep duration for cognitive performance is approximately 7 to 8 hours per night, with significant implications for both younger and older adults.

Given the six-year period between measurement of inflammation and sleep duration, these results suggest that the contemporaneous inflammation-long sleep duration association may not be driven solely by acute illness but likely reflects longer-term physiological processes. Discussion From our cross-sectional data, we found virtually no relationship between biomarkers of inflammation and the overall sleep quality index or its subcomponents. In contrast, we found a strong relationship between long sleep duration and most markers of inflammation, with little evidence of associations between short sleep duration and inflammation.

This result may support the hypothesis that high inflammation is related to long sleep duration via the worsening of co-morbidities associated with inflammation. This work is consistent with some, but not all, previous research on inflammation and sleep. For example, Okun et al. (2009) found that poor sleep quality as measured by the PSQI was associated with higher CRP but not with IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) in a sample of 43 young U.S. women, with no associations between inflammatory markers and sleep duration as measured continuously, consistent with our primarily negative findings for sleep quality and continuous sleep duration(5). Friedman et al.

This explanation would be consistent with our findings that increases in inflammation between waves predicted long sleep duration in the second wave, and broader findings in the literature of an association between long sleep and mortality. An additional limitation is that self-reported sleep quality and duration are likely measured with error, which could contribute to our null findings for the PSQI sleep components and inflammation. Objective monitoring methods such as wrist- watch actigraphy have recently beenemployed in population surveys to measure more precisely various aspects of sleep quality and sleep duration (48). Our study contributes to the sparse literature on long sleep duration and inflammation, which may be particularly salient for older populations. The current study's strengths include a large sample size compared with previous studies, an extensive array of inflammatory markersincluding measures of change for most markers-- and one of the first investigations of these associations in a non-Western sample. Afternoon naps are customary among the elderly in Taiwan, with some evidence suggesting that nappers have better nocturnal sleep quality(49). Since the PSQI asks only about nighttime sleep duration, it is possible that total sleep duration is longer than reported, making short nighttime sleep duration less detrimental and longer nighttime sleep duration a stronger indicator of poor health. Future work on sleep duration and inflammation should move beyond an exclusive focus on short sleep and examine the potential importance of long sleep as a marker of underlying inflammatory illness. Prospective studies of sleep and inflammatory markers can help shed light on whether these relationships are causal or are driven by other factors. Such studies could also help elucidate the role of inflammation in the observed association between long sleep and mortality, contributing to our understanding of sleep as both a cause and consequence of ill health.

Inflammation may play a role in mediating these associations. MethodsWe examined associations between inflammation and self-reported sleep characteristics in 1020 respondents of the 2000 and 2006 Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS), a nationally representative survey of Taiwanese adults ages 53 and over. Regression models were used to estimate cross-sectional relationships between inflammation (IL-6, CRP, fibrinogen, e-selectin, sICAM-1, albumin, and WBC) and a modified Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), index subcomponents, and self-reported sleep duration. Change in inflammatory markers between 2000 and 2006 was also used to predict long or short sleep duration in 2006. ResultsInflammation was not related to the overall index of sleep quality. However, longer sleep (> 8 hours) was associated with higher levels of inflammation. These associations remained after adjustment for waist circumference, self-reported health decline, diabetes, arthritis/ rheumatism, heart disease, and depressive symptoms. Increases in inflammation between 2000 and 2006 were associated with long but not short sleep duration in 2006 for several markers.

Statistical Analysis First, we estimated linear regression models with each inflammatory marker as an outcome to examine cross-sectional associations between individual markers and the overall modified PSQI as well as the five PSQI sleep components, adjusted for age and sex. PSQI subcomponents were entered linearly (0-3); results were similar when scores were used as indicator variables. Linear probability regression models were run for the dichotomous CRP variables, the overall inflammation index, and the dichotomous indicator of high overall inflammation (results using logit models for binary outcomes were very similar). Next, we ran analogous models for each inflammatory marker using a categorical measure of sleep duration (<6 hours, 6-8 hours, >8 hours) as the predictor, with and without adjustment for potential health mediators. Finally, because of the possibility that inflammation can promote sleep (18), we tested whether increases in inflammation between Dowd et al. Page 4 Ann Epidemiol.

This analysis included all markers except fibrinogen (which was collected only in 2006), and was based on respondents who participated in both waves (n=639). For each biomarker, we used a multinomial logit model with sleep duration coded categorically as the dependent variable, adjusted for age, sex and baseline inflammation levels. Because some studies have found sex differences in relationships between inflammation and sleep (13, 43), we also tested for interactions by sex; these interactions were not statistically significant and thus were not included in our final models. Results The average age of the sample was 66 years, with 6.4 average hours of reported sleep (Table 1). Overall, there were few associations between the inflammatory markers and the PSQI subcomponents or the overall PSQI (Table 2). There were no significant associations for CRP, IL-6, fibrinogen, WBC, or albumin. sICAM-1 showed marginally significant positive associations with the overall index (p0.057), sleep efficiency (p0.092), and a significant association with the index measure of short sleep duration (p.012).

The overall (shortened) PSQI was a sum of the five subcomponents, with a range of (0-15). In accordance with the traditional PSQI scale, sleep duration was coded categorically (0=7 hours, 1=6 to <7 hours, 2=5 to <6 hours, and 3=<5 hours). Because of potential associations between both long and short sleep duration and health outcomes, we also categorized sleep duration as <6 hours, 6-8 hours, and >8 hours for separate non-linear analyses. Inflammatory markers Inflammatory markers were assayed from overnight fasting serum samples. We examined all inflammation-related markers measured in SEBAS I and II: C-Reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), white blood cell count (WBC), fibrinogen (SEBAS II only), albumin, e- selectin, and sICAM-1; measures of IL-6, e-selectin, sICAM-1, and CRP for SEBAS I were derived from frozen specimens collected in 2000 and assayed between 2007 and 2009. CRP, an acute phase protein, is an important component of the non-specific innate immune system response to infection and injury and is often used as a general marker of systemic inflammation (32, 33). IL-6 is the primary inflammatory cytokine responsible for upregulation of CRP (34). Fibrinogen is an acute phase protein that plays an important role 1The original PSQI contains two additional subcomponents: sleep disturbances and use of sleep medication (30). Subsequent research has shown that the sleep medication component is not significantly associated with the global PSQI score, and sleep disturbances had a low correlation with the global score (31).

This association persisted even after adjusting for various health factors including waist circumference, self-reported health decline, diabetes, arthritis/rheumatism, heart disease, and depressive symptoms (dowd2011sleep, dowd2011sleep_chunk_001).\n\n2. **Risk of Long Sleep Duration**: Increases in inflammation between 2000 and 2006 were linked to a higher risk of long sleep duration in 2006. Specifically, higher baseline levels of IL-6 and e-selectin predicted long sleep duration six years later, independent of changes in these levels (dowd2011sleep, dowd2011sleep_chunk_011).\n\n3. **No Association with Short Sleep Duration**: The evidence suggests that there was little to no association between short sleep duration and inflammation markers.

Briefly, the SRI provides a gran- ular measure of concordance in patterns of sleep and wake states across days of recording, with higher scores indicative of greater interdaily consistency in sleepwake timing [6, 7]. Among the 60 997 middle-aged to elderly men and women with valid SRI data, 1859 deaths occurred between 2013 and 2021, equating to 4.84 deaths per 1000 person-years. The authors found that greater sleep regularity was associated with significantly lower risk for all-cause mortality. In fact, relative to the lowest quintile of SRI, the highest quintile, representing those with the most stable interdaily sleepwake patterns, had 30% lower risk of mortality from all causes and 38% lower risk of cardiometabolic mortal- ity. Interestingly, while sleep duration was also found to predict mortality incidence, SRI produced larger minimum risk estimates for each mortality outcome aside from cardiometabolic deaths. This pattern was confirmed in models directly evaluating the predictive value of SRI versus sleep duration. Most notably, SRI produced a better fit for all-cause mortality data than did sleep duration [6]. Thus, this study not only found that sleep regularity was a significant predictor of all-cause and cause-specific mortal- ity but also suggests that consistency across nights in sleepwake timing may be more strongly related to mortality risk than sleep duration. Findings from Windred et al. [6] of an inverse relationship between sleep regularity and mortality risk have high public health relevance and support the need for this dimension of sleep to be considered in strategies for health promotion. For example, sleep duration has been formally recognized as a key determi- nant of cardiometabolic health [8], leading to its recent inclusion as one of the American Heart Associations Essential eight com- ponents of cardiovascular health [9]. The study from Windred et al. [6] adds to a growing body of evidence that regularity of nightly sleep is an independent correlate of future morbidity and mortal- ity that confers equal, if not greater, predictive value than sleep duration. While there is unequivocal evidence for a critical role of sleep duration in cardiometabolic health [8], irregular sleep, also a directly modifiable lifestyle behavior, is now strongly linked with both cardiometabolic costs [2] and mortality [6].

In spite of the aforementioned description of a sleep-deprived society [9], we are unable to conrm decreases in adult sleep duration since there is no data available from the early 1900s. However, it should also be noted that Matricciani et al. described that not adults sleep duration but adults sleep quality is declining recently [11]. The importance of sleep quality has gained recognition as an important sleep char- acteristic much later than studies conducted solely on sleep quantity. In 1964, Hammond reported that those who had a sleep duration of 7 h showed the lowest mortality during a 2-year follow up, with increasing death rates on both the shorter and the longer sides of this nadir [12]. Hammond also reported an association between insomnia and mortality in men [12]. Although no detail on the denition of insomnia was given in the report, non-restorative sleep or not feeling refreshed after sleeping was described as a symptom of insomnia in the 4th [13] and the 5th [14] editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, respectively. Thus, it may not be wrong to say that Hammonds insomnia could express a kind of sleep quality. After this study, however, many studies were conducted with a focus on the relationship between sleep duration and both mental and physical disorders, and Ford and Kamerow revealed in 1989 that insomnia increased the risk of psychiatric disorders [15]. At present, there is no denitive denition that can be used to assess sleep quality. In fact, a scale that is commonly used worldwide for assessing sleep quality (the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)) is known, but the questions in the PSQI are about usual sleep habits during the last month. According to Pilz et al. [16], the PSQI reveals sleep quality on workdays. The PSQI is presumed not to be a perfect scale for measuring sleep quality. Several recent studies [1729] have used a simple question to assess sleep quality, and the details of this are introduced in a subsequent section. This review looks at both sleep quantity and sleep quality, considering how to manage the complex but probably unavoidable physiological phenomenon of sleep. Not enough data on these issues were obtained from children, however, this review tried to accumulate child data on both sleep quantity and sleep quality. 2.

While numerous studies have focused on sleep duration, with both short and long sleep durations associated with adverse mental health outcomes (Chunnan, Shaomei, & Wannian, 2022), mounting evidence suggests that other dimensions of sleep may be equally important. Sleep regularity, the day-to-day consistency in sleepwake timing rather than the amount of sleep obtained, has emerged as a potentially critical component of healthy sleep (Windred et al., 2024). The sleep regularity index (SRI), developed by Phillips et al., quantifies the probability of an individual being in the same sleepwake state at any two time points 24 hours apart (Phillips et al., 2017), thus capturing the stability of circadian timing independent of total sleep duration.

Screen exposure, especially near bedtime, directly leads to poor sleep quality. We aimed to measure smartphone screen-time (ST) statistics of the participants directly using a smartphone application. Furthermore, we aimed to assess sleep quality using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), and to investigate the association between ST & PSQI. Material and Methods: This descriptive cohort study was conducted among 280 students of MBBS at Rawalpindi Medical University for a period of 1 month (30 days). Physically healthy students who owned Android smartphones were included in the study. Students with diagnosed sleep disorders and students taking sleep medication were excluded from the study. ST was recorded using a smartphone application. Sleep quality was assessed at the end of 30 days using the PSQI questionnaire. Data entry and analysis was done using SPSS v23.0. Results: Total and mean ST were calculated for every participant. The mean screen time of 242 individuals was 147.5051.09 hours. The mean PSQI score was 6.682.3. 65.70% of the participants had a poor sleep quality (PSQI>5). Pearsons correlation revealed that long total ST was associated with decreased sleep quality (R=0.356, p<0.001). Conclusion: Our ndings are in accordance with previous scientific literature largely based on self-reported ST measurements and affirm that excessive ST deteriorates sleep quality and hence has numerous adverse physical and psychological manifestations.

However, most existing research relies on self-reported smartphone use data, which are suscepti- ble to recall bias and misclassification. The inconsistencies across findings highlight the critical need for more objective measures of smartphone screen time and unlocks to capture the true associations between smartphone use and sleep. To date, few studies have leveraged objectively measured smartphone use data to explore associations with sleep [13, 56,57], and no consensus has been reached regarding these relationships. A study directly measured smartphone screen time in 136 participants via a tracking app and found that longer smartphone screen time was associated with poorer sleep efficiency and shorter sleep duration [56]. A Chinese study tracked participants smartphone use using the same method and indicated that each minute of daytime smartphone use was related to a 0.07-minute reduction in same-night total sleep time but unrelated to sleep efficiency and postsleep awakenings [57]. Only 1 recent study identified smartphone screen time and unlocks as significant predictors of total sleep time, albeit concluding that this effect was minimal [13]. All 3 of these studies concur that excessive objectively meas- ured smartphone use reduces sleep duration while showing less consistency in their findings regarding the impact on sleep quality, particularly sleep efficiency. Notably, our study confirmed that excessive smartphone screen time and unlocks were associated with reductions in sleep duration by 6.66 minutes and 9.90 minutes per night, respectively, as well as an increased risk of poor sleep. Novelly, an inverted Ushaped nonlinear association was observed between smartphone screen time and reduc- tion in sleep duration. The inverted Ushaped relationship was matched by a corresponding delay in sleep offset. No previous studies have focused on the dose-response relationship between smartphone use and sleep, although some support can be drawn from several studies on pre- sleep smartphone use. For example, a study that objectively assessed smartphone use before sleep using a tracking app found that using smartphones before sleep for longer than usual was associated with sleeping earlier and sleeping longer among adolescents [58], suggesting a potentially positive effect on sleep duration. A recent study showed that total screen use in the 2 hours before bedtime was associated with delayed sleep onset but not with total sleep time [9]. Similarly, Exelmans and Van den Bulck [59] suggested that bedtime smartphone use predicted later rise times, which may indicate a compensation behavior for missed sleep.

Adequate and high-qual- ity sleep plays a pivotal role in sustaining physiological and psychological well-being. Poor sleep quality alongside inadequate duration is both prevalent and strongly linked to elevated risks of adverse health outcomes [2-4] and, thus, has become a notable concern. Over recent decades, epidemio- logical evidence has indicated a progressive deterioration in both average sleep quality and duration [5], with roughly 33% of the global population falling short of internation- ally recommended nocturnal sleep thresholds (79 hours per night). Given the public health impact of poor and insuffi- cient sleep, there is a critical need to better understand the potential influence of ubiquitous smartphones in impairing sleep health. Numerous studies have linked smartphone use with poor sleep and shorter sleep duration [6-12], whereas few studies have reported that smartphone screen time correlates with poorer sleep quality but has minimal effects on sleep duration [9,13]. Conversely, 2 studies found no association between the daily use of technology devices and sleep outcomes [14, 15]. Notably, the current generation of youth, referred to as iGens by Twenge [16], has grown up in the smartphone era and is characterized by elevated rates of smartphone use and smartphone addiction [17]. University students today belong to the iGeneration, who are more prone to severe smartphone addiction and maladaptive use that may impair sleep quality and duration in the absence of familial oversight. This risk is particularly concerning because poor or insuffi- cient sleep can exacerbate mental health issues, which have already garnered broad societal attention,", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 3246, "end_char": 5843, "similarity_score": 0.7558037042617798}, {"chunk_id": "arshad2021adverse_chunk_002", "source_id": "arshad2021adverse", "text": ".001).

Sleep Sci. 2021;14(4):337-341 INTRODUCTION The advent of smartphones took the world by storm, and smartphones have nearly become ubiquitous, especially in the developed and developing countries. This has led, inevitably, to smartphone dependency and excessive usage. Problematic over usage of smartphones has manifested as an array of deteriorating effects including poor sleep quality. Smartphone usage, especially near bedtime, worsens ones experience of sleep and directly leads to poor sleep quality. The encyclopedia of behavioral medicine defines sleep quality as ones satisfaction of the sleep experience, integrating aspects of sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, quantity, and refreshment upon awakening1. Smartphone screens emit blue light in the short wavelength region (380nm to 495nm). This blue light is considered to be responsible for suppressing the production of melatonin hormone, which is one of the key components in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. This leads to sleep disturbances and contributes to poor sleep quality2. Sleep disturbances have drastic adverse effects on physical and mental health. Poor sleep quality has been reported to increase the risk of weight gain, obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, glucose intolerance, and diabetes3-6. Sleep deprivation negatively affects cognitive functions7 and can also lead to depression, stress, and anxiety8,9. This study aimed to directly measure the duration for which a person uses the smartphone, i.e., screen time (ST) and to find an association between ST and sleep quality, quantitatively measured by Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). There is a multitude of studies that have been conducted among students to explore the prevalence of decreased sleep quality10-12, but there is a scarcity of studies investigating the direct associations between sleep quality and smartphone usage. Thus, we aim to contribute to this knowledge gap. Recognizing the adverse effects of excessive phone usage on sleep quality, and subsequently", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 1724, "end_char": 4337, "similarity_score": 0.7490008473396301}, {"chunk_id": "yin2025associations_chunk_031", "source_id": "yin2025associations", "text": " had better mood and lower loneliness than those with low smartphone use [65]. Third, in terms of sleep behavior patterns, individuals with low smartphone use may exhibit an earlier sleep phase, especially for those who rise early, which can result in objectively shorter total sleep duration. An objective measurement study using a wearable sleep and activity tracker, smartphone-delivered ecological momentary assessments, and passive smartphone use tracking also reported a similar pattern [65], finding that individuals with low bedtime smartphone use had earlier wake times (9:25 AM; 1 hour, 30 minutes to +1 hour, 30 minutes) than high bedtime smartphone users (10:08 AM; 1 hour, 49 minutes to +1 hour, 49 minutes). Limitations First, although the models included a wide range of dem- ographic and lifestyle factors, some confounding variables may have remained unaccounted for, potentially influencing the study findings. Second, sleep quality and duration were assessed using a retrospective self-report questionnaire, which may result in recall bias. Future studies would benefit from incorporating objective sleep measurements to triangulate the findings. Third, due to the cross-sectional study design, causal inferences regarding the relationship between smartphone use and sleep cannot be made. Future longitudinal studies are warranted to address it. Fourth, the generalizability of our findings may be limited by the exclusive focus on university students in China and the uneven sex distribution in the study sample. Fifth, although this study objectively meas- ured smartphone use time and frequency via smartphone screenshot, data in this study still lack granularity regarding temporal dynamics (eg, distribution over the day or week) and functional variation (eg, social media, entertainment, education, or work). These details may be important for understanding the nuanced associations between smartphone use and sleep. Sixth, although the multilevel model treating class membership as a random effect yielded substantially unchanged results, this study did not account for cluster- ing effects stemming from shared living or social environ- ments (eg, classes, dormitories, and clubs). Future research could address these clustering effects by implementing simple random sampling methods, which would help minimize potential biases arising from nonindependent observations. Conclusions This study found significant associations between smart- phone addiction, excessive objectively measured screen time, and unlocks and both poor sleep and shorter sleep dura- tion. RCS analyses revealed different nuanced dose-response relationships, with an inverted Ushaped association observed between smartphone screen time and sleep duration.

However, there was evidence of between-study heterogeneity in this regard. We found participants health status was the potential source of heterogeneity. Based on subgroup analysis, there were sig- nificant effects of melatonin supplementation on sleep qual- ity in subjects with respiratory diseases, metabolic disorders, and sleep disorders, but in subjects with mental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, other diseases such as breast cancer, migraine, patients under MMT, alcohol use disorder, cirrhosis, IBS, brain injury, did not show any significant effect. Besides, we observed that subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention was another source of heterogeneity however, both interventions improved sleep quality signifi- cantly. Also, we found that both doses ( 3 mg and > 3 mg) increased sleep quality significantly.

It has a substan- tial role to regulate the circadian rhythm and sleep during the night. It has also been suggested that melatonin may act to facilitate sleep by inhibiting the circadian drive for waking that comes from the suprachiasmatic nucleus [55]. 210 Journal of Neurology (2022) 269:205216 1 3 Table 2 Characteristics of included studies Author Country Year Study design Population Gender Sample size (inter- vention/ control) Mean age (interven- tion/control) Intervention Duration (weeks) Daily dose (mg) Study result Chen et al US 2014 Parallel Breast cancer Woman 39 41 59 59 Melatonin 16 3 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Kotlarczyk et al US 2012 Parallel Perimenopausal women Woman 13 5 50.3 47.5 Melatonin 24 3 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Gendy et al Canada 2020 Parallel Alcohol use disorder Mix 30 30 _ _ Melatonin 4 5 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Campos et al Brazil 2004 Parallel Asthma Woman 11 ", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 18511, "end_char": 20805, "similarity_score": 0.7475852966308594}, {"chunk_id": "fatemeh2021effect_chunk_019", "source_id": "fatemeh2021effect", "text": " use of melatonin, and it can take many years for symptoms of toxicity to develop [63].

Some studies demonstrated that long-term use of melatonin is well tolerated, without any crucial side effect [31, 48, 65]. However, there are con- cerns about chronic use of melatonin, in large doses it may interact with other medications [66]. Limitations The current study has some limitations. Most analyses had high levels of heterogeneity, but this is expected because included studies had participants with different health con- ditions or doses and duration. Additionally, there were not enough studies to evaluate sleep problems in some dis- eases. Moreover, our search was limited to published Eng- lish studies. Also, in this study, we used the PSQI global score to assess sleep quality, it seems that it is better to evaluate PSQI components separately.

Keywords Melatonin  Sleep quality  PSQI  Meta-analysis Introduction Sleep as a physiological and behavioral process is essential for body regulation and quality of life at any age[1]. Nowa- days, sleep quality is often declined, and sleep deprivation or restriction causes several physiological and behavioral changes.[2] Inadequate sleep, in terms of either quantity or quality, is a known risk factor for several diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, vascular disorders, metabolic dysfunction and neurocognitive and leading to an increase in mortality and create a substantial burden on the health care system [36]. Also, the sleep distur- bance causes clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning [7]. Almost a third of the worlds population suffers from sleep disorders, mainly insomnia, because of stressful working conditions and aging and these disorders are more com- mon in women and the elderly [8]. Current medications have substantial adverse events, such as excessive day- time sleepiness, poor tolerance to the medication, cogni- tive impairment, dependency and withdrawal [9]. Due to these side effects, there has been an increased interest to find a new pharmaceutical with less side effects and non- pharmaceutical approach such as yoga, physical exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, acupuncture, mindfulness, * Mirzaei Khadijeh mirzaei_kh@sina.tums.ac.ir 1 Department", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 1513, "end_char": 3811, "similarity_score": 0.7448903322219849}, {"chunk_id": "fatemeh2021effect_chunk_017", "source_id": "fatemeh2021effect", "text": " contrast, a meta-analysis by Buscemi et al.[61] reported that melatonin supplementation in people who had sleep dis- orders with sleep restriction is not effective on sleep onset latency and found that melatonin has no effect in reliving sleep problems. Additionally, some randomized, placebo- controlled trials indicated that melatonin intervention cannot improve the quality of sleep [12, 13]. In the current meta-analysis, we used one questioner to measure sleep quality, so, it can enhance the reliability of our results. Our study in subgroup analysis found that health status was the main source of heterogeneity.

Design: A blinded, randomized split-plot experimental study. Setting: Two urban academic clinical centers. Participants: 107 participants (68% female, mean age 42  11) with major depressive disorder and insomnia. Interventions: Randomization was to one of three groups: antidepressant (AD; escitalopram) + CBT-I (4 sessions), CBT-I + placebo pill, or AD + 4-session sleep hygiene control (SH). Measurements and Results: Subjective sleep was assessed via 2 weeks of daily sleep diaries (use of medication was covaried in all analyses); although there were no statistically significant group differences detected, all groups improved from baseline to posttreatment on subjective sleep efficiency (SE) and total wake time (TWT) and the effect sizes were large. Objective sleep was assessed via overnight polysomnographic monitoring at baseline and posttreatment; anal- yses revealed both CBT groups improved on TWT (p = .03), but the AD + SH group worsened. There was no statistically significant effect for PSG SE (p = .07). There was a between groups medium effect observed for the AD + SH and CBT + placebo group differences on diary TWT and both PSG variables.

Perhaps because the insomnia of MDD patients traditionally has been viewed as an MDD symp- tom rather than a comorbid disorder, the sleep-specific treat- ment needs of MDD patients have been largely ignored until recently. Addressing this gap in the literature is important when the prevalence of MDD and sleep complaints are considered; 90% of those in clinical settings presenting with MDD com- plain of sleep problems,15,16 and MDD plus insomnia patients actually outnumber insomnia-only patients in sleep clinics by almost 2:1.1719 Considering the persistence and potential long- term significance that insomnia may have for MDD patients, well-designed studies to test the benefits of insomnia-targeted therapies for those who present comorbid MDD and insomnia are urgently needed. Of the available treatments, Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) represents an attractive option for comorbid MDD/insomnia patients. CBT-I is currently considered a safe, efficacious, and durable therapy for the treatment of insomnia disorder (ID).20 Studies suggest that the psychological factors targeted by CBT-I presumed to perpetuate the sleep problems among ID sufferers generally are also common in insomnia patients with comorbid depression.12,21 In addition, CBT-I has been shown to successfully reduce these sleep-disruptive factors and to improve the sleep of patients with insomnia and comor- bid mental disorders, even in those receiving pharmacotherapy for depression.22 One study evaluating CBT-I for those with residual MDD and refractory insomnia after adequate pharma- cotherapy for depression found that both sleep and depression improved significantly more among the CBT-I group than those treated as usual with only pharmacotherapy.23 Furthermore, research suggests that significant improvements in sleep are associated with mood improvements and even remission of the depressive episode.2426 Taken together, these studies provide convincing early evi- dence that CBT-I is effective for improvement in sleep and may also lead to additional improvement in depression symp- toms. Unfortunately, the studies conducted to date lacked both proper control groups and objective (polysomnography [PSG]) verification of sleep changes. An exploration of PSG-measured sleep is important because we know that antidepressants can cause objective sleep problems (for review see27).

SLEEP, Vol. 40, No. 4, 2017 this therapy fails to meet standards of evidence as an effective monotherapy33 (see also57). This group also was taking anti- depressant medication, so the positive subjective effects may be related to the antidepressant itself; that is, in other studies, some depressed patients taking SSRIs report subjective sleep improvements.58,59 It is unclear whether this effect is due to the perception that the depression is improving with the medication and thus sleep also is rated more favorably. Previous research has shown that subjective assessment of insomnia using sleep items on depression inventories is associated with modest improvement in some58,59 and worsening in others.60 The lack of a follow-up period precludes us from knowing whether the subjective benefit would have any durability. Another possible explanation for the lack of separation for the sleep hygiene and CBT-I groups on subjective insomnia improve- ment may relate to the dose of CBT-I in this trial. Participants in this study were those with both insomnia and MDD. Although 4 sessions are optimal in those with insomnia alone,61 it is possible that individuals with both insomnia and depression would benefit from a longer treatment period, as some studies62 report somewhat diminished treatment effect sizes in those with comorbidities. However, a meta-analysis including studies of differing treatment duration found similarly large effects, such as observed in this trial, in those with comorbid insomnias.63 Similarly, it is possible that the therapy was not potent enough because it was delivered by novices (i.e., graduate students). Although fidelity to the protocol was measured formally, there was no formal competence evaluation beyond the observation of the students and weekly supervision of these sleep-therapy naive novice therapists. Additionally, there was some inequality with the AD condition, in that a licensed, medical prescriber with decades more clinical experience was interacting with participants, in comparison to the inexperienced therapists for the cognitive behavioral components. Nonetheless, participant ratings of the therapist/therapy, fidelity assessments, and close supervision by a CBT-I expert (first author) support the idea that the cognitive behavioral components were delivered in a com- petent manner. In fact, it is promising for widespread dissemi- nation that, similar to other studies similar to other studies,6467 this brief insomnia treatment is effectively delivered to complex patients by novice nonsleep specialist providers.

While numerous studies have focused on sleep duration, with both short and long sleep durations associated with adverse mental health outcomes (Chunnan, Shaomei, & Wannian, 2022), mounting evidence suggests that other dimensions of sleep may be equally important. Sleep regularity, the day-to-day consistency in sleepwake timing rather than the amount of sleep obtained, has emerged as a potentially critical component of healthy sleep (Windred et al., 2024). The sleep regularity index (SRI), developed by Phillips et al., quantifies the probability of an individual being in the same sleepwake state at any two time points 24 hours apart (Phillips et al., 2017), thus capturing the stability of circadian timing independent of total sleep duration.

The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan organized a nationwide research team on the quality of sleep (19FA0901). The author was one of the review board members of the team. The team discussed sleepiness during the day, restlessness, and restfulness as candidates for assessing sleep quality. In 2021, the team reached ve conclusions: 1. Sleep quality is a superior sleep index to sleep quantity for assessing sleep; 2. Restfulness obtained through sleep is a useful index for assessing sleep quality; 3. Although PSQI and restfulness are correlated, these two indices are not identical; 4. PSQI includes sleep quantity and insomnia, while restfulness is complementary to either sleep duration, time in bed, or both; and 5. To obtain adequate sleep, people aged 64 or less need a longer sleep duration, whereas those aged 65 or more need a shorter time in bed. By means of a choice-based conjoint analysis, Ramlee et al. concluded that the top three parameters that determine sleep quality among 17 parameters were total sleep quantity, refreshed feeling upon waking, and the daytime mind state after sleep [64]. Although the study was carried out among older men, Faerman et al. [17] assessed the correlations between subjective sleep quality, determined by 5-point scales for sleep depth and restfulness in the morning, and actigraphic data, as well as heart rate, heart rate variability, and demographic and psychological variables. They found no correlation between the subjective and the objective measures. This result is consistent with a previous study by Kaplan and colleagues [18]. In 3173 men and women aged between 39 and 90, Kaplan et al. assessed the relationship between a morning rating of the prior nights sleep (sleep depth and restfulness) and polysomnographic and quantitative electroen- cephalographic descriptors of that single night of sleep. They concluded that objective data contribute little to explaining subjective sleep quality. They also assessed a single night of at-home polysomnographic recording of sleep followed by a set of morning questions concerning the prior nights sleep quality in older men (n = 1024) and women (n = 459) [19].

Participants were included in the SRI calculation only if they had at least five valid days of accelerom- eter data, recorded for a minimum of 16 hours per day. This ensured that only high-quality data were used for downstream analyses. An SRI score of 100 indicates perfectly consistent sleep wake patterns, while a score of 0 reflects completely random patterns. Participants were categorized as irregular (025th per- centile, SRI 51); moderately irregular (2575th percentile, 52 SRI 70); and regular (75100th percentile, SRI 71) sleepers (Windred et al., 2021). Sleep duration data were extracted based on the same study days used for calculating the SRI. For each participant, the daily average sleep duration was calculated based on the period of sustained inactivity between sleep onset and offset times, as estimated by GGIR (Windred et al., 2024). The overall average sleep duration for each participant was then derived by aggregating these daily values across the study period. Participants were categorized based on whether they met the sleep duration recommendation of 79 hours per day for adults aged 1864 years or 78 hours per day for adults aged over 65 years (Hirshkowitz et al., 2015; Ross et al., 2020). Outcomes Depression and anxiety diagnoses were identified in participants through multiple sources, including hospital inpatient records, primary care, and death registry data. The primary care data captured information recorded by healthcare professionals in gen- eral practice settings, which typically identifies mental health con- ditions earlier than hospital admissions. The classification of depressive and anxiety disorders was based on the 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases, using diagnostic codes F32 (depressive episode) and F33 (recurrent depressive dis- order) for depression, and F40F48 (neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders) for anxiety, including all subcategories (Fan et al., 2025).

The Sleep Regularity Index (SRI), introduced in 2017, quantifies an individuals sleep/wake cycle consistency over time, by measuring the likelihood of being in the same state (asleep or awake) at two points separated by 24 h (Phillips et al., 2017). Research has associated the SRI with factors such as circadian misalignment (Phillips et al., 2017), academic performance (Phillips et al., 2017), cardiovascular risk (Lunsford-Avery et al., 2018), and self-reported depression severity (Lunsford-Avery et al., 2018). Lower SRI scores have also been linked to relapse and excessive daytime napping during inpatient treatment in individuals with alcohol use disorder (Barb et al., 2022; Brooks et al., 2020). Conversely, higher SRI scores, indicating more regular sleep and wake times, were associated with decreased mental exhaustion in the same population (Brooks et al., 2020).

For instance, Li et al. (2025) highlight that \"sleep regularity, the day-to-day consistency in sleep-wake timing rather than the amount of sleep obtained, has emerged as a potentially critical component of healthy sleep\" (li2025regular, li2025regular_chunk_003). Similarly, Maki et al. (2025) note that \"consistency in sleep and wake times have been linked to various health outcomes\" (maki2025sleep, maki2025sleep_chunk_003).\n\n2. **Sleep Quality vs. Quantity**: Kohyama et al. (2021) assert that \"sleep quality is a superior sleep index to sleep quantity for assessing sleep\" (kohyama2021which, kohyama2021which_chunk_014). This aligns with Li et al. (2025), which suggests that sleep regularity (a quality measure) is critical for mental health outcomes, indicating a consensus that quality (including regularity) may be more important than sheer quantity (li2025regular, li2025regular_chunk_003).\n\n**Areas of Disagreement:**\n\n1. **Assessment of Sleep Quantity**: Kohyama et al. (2021) argue that sleep quantity should be assessed not by actual duration but by a deviation from an individual's own optimal sleep quantity (kohyama2021which, kohyama2021which_chunk_023). This perspective contrasts with Li et al. (2025), which categorizes participants based on whether they meet the recommended sleep duration of 7-9 hours for adults aged 18-64 and 7-8 hours for those over 65 (li2025regular, li2025regular_chunk_007). This indicates a divergence in how sleep quantity is conceptualized and measured.\n\n2. **Focus on Sleep Duration**: While Li et al. (2025) provide a structured approach to categorizing sleep duration and its relationship with mental health, Kohyama et al. (2021) emphasize that many studies favor sleep quality over quantity, suggesting that the focus on total sleep hours may not adequately reflect health or functioning issues (kohyama2021which, kohyama2021which_chunk_023). This highlights a disagreement on the prioritization of sleep duration versus quality in research and assessment.\n\n**Conclusion**: Overall, while there is a consensus on the importance of sleep regularity and quality, there are differing views on how to assess sleep quantity and its relevance to health outcomes.

Preliminary studies support the perceived credibility of SH as an insomnia treatment. Also, SH recommendations have good face validity, as they are often used in clinical practice. Nonetheless, sleep hygiene recommendations are ineffective for treating insomnia when used in the absence of other insomnia therapies.33,34 In the current trial, each participant assigned to this condition received the SH intervention during 4 biweekly 1-hr individual therapy sessions with a study therapist. Thus, both groups had the same amount of therapist contact. During the first SH session, the therapist reviewed the patients sleep diaries without sugges- tions for altering the observed sleep schedule. SH consisted of descriptions of sleep stages, normal sleep architecture, and sleep cycles presented via an animated Powerpoint presenta- tion. After presenting this educational information, the therapist discussed a series of recommendations from the manual enti- tled Overcoming Insomnia,28 including eliminating caffeine and alcohol, avoiding exercise and other physical activity just prior to bed, having a light snack before bed, and keeping the bedroom quiet, dark, and at a comfortable temperature. These recommendations were applied to the participants own circum- stances in detail, such as planning a particular sleep-inducing snack (e.g., milk, peanut butter, and crackers) or not scheduling exercise right before bed. In addition to receiving these verbal instructions, SH patients were given a take-home pamphlet reit- erating the sleep hygiene instructions. During subsequent SH sessions, the therapist reviewed the logs and the sleep hygiene recommendations and addressed treatment adherence problems.

DISCUSSION Results from this trial indicate that although three combinations of depression and insomnia treatments were helpful in produc- ing subjective improvements for insomnia and depression, a depression-only approach objectively worsened sleep. That is, on objective (PSG) indices, there was improvement in mean total time awake for the CBT-I groups, but the AD + SH group actually worsened on this index. The same trend was shown on objective SE. Subsequently, we explore the possible reasons for this differ- ence in subjective versus objective sleep outcomes as well as dis- cuss the depression response with an insomnia-specific treatment. With respect to subjective insomnia indices, all groups did reasonably well, with improved scores on both ISI and sleep diary indices from baseline to posttreatment. One possible explanation may relate to sleep hygiene being a poor control sleep therapy condition. This therapy controlled for nonspe- cific effects, as the material was presented by the same ther- apists for the same amount of time as CBT-I groups. There is some support for sleep hygiene as a treatment for insomnia (e.g.,55,56); however, when considering the evidence collectively, Figure 2Polysomnography (PSG) change in total wake time.

SLEEP, Vol. 40, No. 4, 2017 this therapy fails to meet standards of evidence as an effective monotherapy33 (see also57). This group also was taking anti- depressant medication, so the positive subjective effects may be related to the antidepressant itself; that is, in other studies, some depressed patients taking SSRIs report subjective sleep improvements.58,59 It is unclear whether this effect is due to the perception that the depression is improving with the medication and thus sleep also is rated more favorably. Previous research has shown that subjective assessment of insomnia using sleep items on depression inventories", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 47042, "end_char": 49415, "similarity_score": 0.7521560192108154}, {"chunk_id": "carney2017cognitive_chunk_032", "source_id": "carney2017cognitive", "text": ".6871 Thus, there were subjective improvements reported by many of those on antide- pressants but an objective worsening if the antidepressant was paired with sleep hygiene (i.e., CBT-I was not used). Given the widespread use and belief that sleep hygiene is effective,57 this finding suggests antidepressants should not be augmented with sleep hygiene if improved objective sleep is desired. Although subjective sleep is the most typical target in insomnia treatment, growing research suggests that objective indices such as total sleep time may relate to adverse health outcomes such as cogni- tive impairment, hypertension, and diabetes.7274 Thus, evidence of objective sleep worsening in antidepressant therapy is cause for concern. There were no differences in depression whether someone received a depression treatment or not; that is, all three groups showed improvements with large effect sizes on depression. The between-group effects were small which has been found in other studies examining CBT-I.78 These results are also consist- ent with previous studies suggesting CBT-I is associated with improvements in depression symptoms as well as increased rates of depressive remission.75 In another study CBT-I was shown to potentiate the antidepressant effects of the medication,24 but this did not occur in this study. Although posttreatment sleep pre- dicted posttreatment depression status, there was no evidence that the combined depression and insomnia treatment fared any better than the CBT-I alone group or the AD + SH group. It is unclear why we did not see this effect. The Manber et al. study was a small study and the only comparison study to date, so it is possible that these findings were anomalous. It is also possible that this study was statistically underpowered, since our final sample size was less than the a priori power analysis suggested was necessary. The CBT-I + PD was no different than the active antidepres- sant medication treatment groups on depression symptom sever- ity, and their sleep was objectively and subjectively improved (the effect sizes for this group in comparison to the AD+SH control were medium in size for diary and PSG TWT as well as PSG SE). Given that this group did well with respect to sleep, and just as well with respect to depression, it may be tempting to see this insomnia-only treatment choice as viable because it Table 4Multiple regression predicting posttreatment HAMD17 with sleep items removed.

SLEEP, Vol. 40, No. 4, 2017 this therapy fails to meet standards of evidence as an effective monotherapy33 (see also57).

Previous research has shown that subjective assessment of insomnia using sleep items on depression inventories is associated with modest improvement in some58,59 and worsening in others.60 The lack of a follow-up period precludes us from knowing whether the subjective benefit would have any durability. Another possible explanation for the lack of separation for the sleep hygiene and CBT-I groups on subjective insomnia improve- ment may relate to the dose of CBT-I in this trial. Participants in this study were those with both insomnia and MDD. Although 4 sessions are optimal in those with insomnia alone,61 it is possible that individuals with both insomnia and depression would benefit from a longer treatment period, as some studies62 report somewhat diminished treatment effect sizes in those with comorbidities. However, a meta-analysis including studies of differing treatment duration found similarly large effects, such as observed in this trial, in those with comorbid insomnias.63 Similarly, it is possible that the therapy was not potent enough because it was delivered by novices (i.e., graduate students). Although fidelity to the protocol was measured formally, there was no formal competence evaluation beyond the observation of the students and weekly supervision of these sleep-therapy naive novice therapists. Additionally, there was some inequality with the AD condition, in that a licensed, medical prescriber with decades more clinical experience was interacting with participants, in comparison to the inexperienced therapists for the cognitive behavioral components. Nonetheless, participant ratings of the therapist/therapy, fidelity assessments, and close supervision by a CBT-I expert (first author) support the idea that the cognitive behavioral components were delivered in a com- petent manner. In fact, it is promising for widespread dissemi- nation that, similar to other studies similar to other studies,6467 this brief insomnia treatment is effectively delivered to complex patients by novice nonsleep specialist providers.

This review looks at both sleep quantity and sleep quality, considering how to manage the complex but probably unavoidable physiological phenomenon of sleep. The need for sleep has marked variations between individuals, in addition to the effects of variable conditions. Studies on sleep quality started later than those on sleep quantity, beginning in 1989 when Ford and Kamerow revealed that insomnia increases the risk of psychiatric disorders. According to the nationwide research team on the quality of sleep (19FA0901), sleep quality is superior to sleep quantity as an index for assessing sleep, and that restfulness obtained through sleep is a useful index for assessing sleep quality. We should pay more attention to obtaining sleep of good quality (restfulness, no sleepiness, no need for more sleep, sufcient objective sleep depth, etc.), although there have not been enough studies on the associations between sleep quality and health or disorders in children and adolescents. Further studies using the deviation from an individuals optimal sleep quantity may show us another aspect of the effects of sleep quantity on various life issues.

The largest adverse effect was observed among short sleepers, reinforcing the importance of maintaining a sleep duration of 68 hours for optimal physical health. Association between sleep duration and general health Adjusted predictive margins for general health status varied substantially by sleep duration category (Table 6). Individuals reporting recommended sleep duration demonstrated the most favorable health profile overall. The adjusted probability of reporting excellent health was highest among adults with recommended sleep (0.077; 95% CI, 0.0750.080), and was markedly lower among those with short sleep (0.049; 95% CI, 0.0470.051) and long sleep (0.033; 95% CI, 0.0310.036). A similar pattern was observed for reports of very good health, which were most common among individuals with recom mended sleep (0.258; 95% CI, 0.2540.261), declining among those with short sleep (0.197; 95% CI, 0.1940.201) and long sleep (0.151; 95% CI, 0.1430.158). In contrast, the probability of reporting fair or poor health increased notably with departure from recommended sleep duration. Adults with long sleep demonstrated the highest predicted probability of fair health (0.313; 95% CI, 0.307 0.319), followed by those with short sleep (0.280; 95% CI, 0.2760.284), and recommended sleepers (0.231; 95% CI, 0.2270.234). This gradient was more pronounced for poor health: long sleepers exhibited a predicted probability of 0.203 (95% CI, 0.1940.213), followed by short sleepers (0.149; 95% CI, 0.1460.152) and recommended sleepers (0.100; 95% CI, s0.0970.102). Patterns for good health status were comparatively similar across groups, although recommended and short sleepers demonstrated slightly higher probabilities (0.335; 95% CI, 0.3310.338 and 0.325; 95% CI, 0.3210.328, respectively) Table 5.

Methods: Baseline data from a lifestyle intervention trial with young adults (ages 1835 years) with SMI included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), mental health, physical health, and health behavior outcomes. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression were used in analyses. Results: Of 150 participants, 76% were categorized with poor sleep quality. Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with sleep quality ( = .438, p < .001); however, no association was found with physical health and health behaviors. Conclusions: Young adults with SMI enrolled in lifestyle interventions may benefit from treatment that addresses sleep as part of a comprehensive approach to health promotion with attention to the role of depressive symptoms in sleep quality.

This suggests a preference for assessing health outcomes based on sleep quality metrics.\n   - Aschbrenner et al. (2022) found that among young adults with serious mental illness, 76% were categorized with poor sleep quality, and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with sleep quality (aschbrenner2022sleep, aschbrenner2022sleep_chunk_001). This indicates that sleep quality is crucial for mental health, particularly in vulnerable populations.\n\n2. **Importance of Sleep Quantity**:\n   - Fasokun et al. (2026) report that maintaining a sleep duration of 6-8 hours is associated with the most favorable health profiles. Individuals with recommended sleep duration had an adjusted probability of reporting excellent health at 0.077, while those with short sleep had a probability of 0.049, and long sleep had a probability of 0.033 (fasokun2026associations, fasokun2026associations_chunk_027). This data underscores the significance of sleep quantity for physical health outcomes.\n\n3. **Interplay Between Sleep Quality and Quantity**:\n   - Kohyama (2021) notes that both sleep quantity and quality are fundamental components of sleep, and that individual variations in sleep needs complicate the assessment of sleep quantity (kohyama2021which, kohyama2021which_chunk_023). This suggests that while both aspects are important, the optimal balance may vary by individual.\n\n4. **Consensus and Divergence**:\n   - There is a consensus that both sleep quality and quantity are important for health, but the emphasis varies. Kohyama and Aschbrenner highlight the critical role of sleep quality, especially in mental health contexts, while Fasokun provides strong evidence for the importance of sleep quantity in physical health outcomes.\n   - The evidence does not provide a definitive conclusion on which is more important overall, indicating that further research is needed to explore the nuanced relationship between sleep quality, quantity, and health outcomes.\n\nIn summary, while sleep quality is often highlighted as a key indicator of health, particularly in mental health contexts, sleep quantity also plays a crucial role in physical health outcomes.

Collectively, these findings indicate a graded, U-shaped association, wherein both short and long sleep are associated with less favorable self-rated general health compared with recom mended sleep duration. Discussion In this large, nationally representative sample of over 300,000 U.S. adults, we observed significant associations between sleep duration and key health outcomes, including depression, poor mental health days, poor physical health days, and self-rated general health. Using IPW to adjust for confounding, we found that both short sleep (5 hours) and long sleep (9 hours) were independently associated with worse health outcomes compared to individuals who reported recom mended sleep duration (68 hours). Our findings reinforce previous literature that short sleep duration is a strong predictor of adverse mental and physical health outcomes [21,4547]. Adults reporting 5 hours of sleep had significantly higher incidence of depression (+14.1%, 95% CI: 13.8%14.4%), longer duration of poor mental health (5.3 days), and poor physical health (4.4 days) in the past month. Furthermore, 44.8% of short sleepers rated their general health as fair or poor. These outcomes are in line with existing evi dence that sleep deprivation can dysregulate emotional [48,49], cognitive [48,50], and immune [48,51,52] functioning. Interestingly, and consistent with emerging literature [53,54], we also found that long sleep duration (9 hours) was associated with higher burden of depression and poorer general health compared to the reference group. Though tradi tionally underexplored, prolonged sleep has increasingly been implicated in poor health outcomes, potentially reflecting underlying undiagnosed health conditions or behavioral and social determinants of health [5557]. For example, those in the  9-hour group had a 12.9% increase in depression incidence and reported worse mental and physical health than the 68-hour group, albeit with slightly lower burden than short sleepers. This U-shaped association highlights that both insufficient and excessive sleep are detrimental to health.

Conclusion Both short (5 hours) and long (9 hours) sleep durations are significantly associated with increased risk of depression, more days of poor mental and physical health, and worse self-rated general health compared to recommended sleep (68 hours). Pro moting optimal sleep duration through targeted public health interventions, education, and screening may improve population well-being and reduce sleep-related health disparities.

Conclusions Both sleep quantity and sleep quality are fundamental components of sleep. Since there are marked inter-individual differences in the need for sleep, sleep quantity might be assessed not by actual duration but by a deviation from the individuals own optimal sleep quantity. For sleep quality, no standardized scale has been established, probably because sleep quality has many aspects. The variables for sleep quality can be selected depending on the purpose of the study. At present, many studies have decided that sleep quality, rather than sleep quantity, is favorable for reecting health or functioning issues. However, these studies used actual values for sleep quantity. Further studies using the deviation from an individuals own optimal sleep quantity may show us another aspect of the effects of sleep quantity on various life issues.

To evaluate the remaining variance in decreased sleep quality was beyond the scope of this study. The remaining variance in sleep quality may be attributed to other factors such as anxiety and emotional stress, as reported by other studies27,28. It is also important to state that these results alone are not enough to establish causation. Further researches and experimental study designs are needed to establish temporality and cause-effect relationships. The Bradford Hill criteria can be used as a guideline in this regard29. Furthermore, we could not account for ST other than smartphones, which includes laptops and television screens. A multivariate analysis accounting for ST across all devices as well as taking into account other factors that influence sleep quality would provide a more inclusive and comprehensive overview. CONCLUSIONS The findings of our study are in accordance with past researches done on the subject and reaffirm that young adults spend a significant amount of time using smartphones, which directly leads to decreased sleep quality. This subsequently predisposes them to multiple adverse physical as well as psychological health outcomes. It is therefore recommended to take measures to decrease ST, particularly in the hours prior to sleeping. The use of blue light filters for screens should be advised, since blue light decreases sleep quality. CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

Adequate and high-qual- ity sleep plays a pivotal role in sustaining physiological and psychological well-being. Poor sleep quality alongside inadequate duration is both prevalent and strongly linked to elevated risks of adverse health outcomes [2-4] and, thus, has become a notable concern. Over recent decades, epidemio- logical evidence has indicated a progressive deterioration in both average sleep quality and duration [5], with roughly 33% of the global population falling short of internation- ally recommended nocturnal sleep thresholds (79 hours per night). Given the public health impact of poor and insuffi- cient sleep, there is a critical need to better understand the potential influence of ubiquitous smartphones in impairing sleep health. Numerous studies have linked smartphone use with poor sleep and shorter sleep duration [6-12], whereas few studies have reported that smartphone screen time correlates with poorer sleep quality but has minimal effects on sleep duration [9,13]. Conversely, 2 studies found no association between the daily use of technology devices and sleep outcomes [14, 15]. Notably, the current generation of youth, referred to as iGens by Twenge [16], has grown up in the smartphone era and is characterized by elevated rates of smartphone use and smartphone addiction [17]. University students today belong to the iGeneration, who are more prone to severe smartphone addiction and maladaptive use that may impair sleep quality and duration in the absence of familial oversight. This risk is particularly concerning because poor or insuffi- cient sleep can exacerbate mental health issues, which have already garnered broad societal attention,", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 3246, "end_char": 5843, "similarity_score": 0.7264905571937561}, {"chunk_id": "arshad2021adverse_chunk_001", "source_id": "arshad2021adverse", "text": "Sleep Sci. 2021;14(4):337-341 337 Effect of excessive smartphone screen time on sleep quality The adverse impact of excessive smartphone screen-time on sleep quality among young adults: A prospective cohort ORIGINAL ARTICLE *Corresponding author: Daneyal Arshad E-mail: daneyal1997@gmail.com Received: November 3, 2020; Accepted: February 10, 2021. DOI: 10.5935/1984-0063.20200114 ABSTRACT Introduction: Problematic over usage of smartphones has led to various deteriorating effects including poor sleep quality. Screen exposure, especially near bedtime, directly leads to poor sleep quality. We aimed to measure smartphone screen-time (ST) statistics of the participants directly using a smartphone application. Furthermore, we aimed to assess sleep quality using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), and to investigate the association between ST & PSQI. Material and Methods: This descriptive cohort study was conducted among 280 students of MBBS at Rawalpindi Medical University for a period of 1 month (30 days). Physically healthy students who owned Android smartphones were included in the study. Students with diagnosed sleep disorders and students taking sleep medication were excluded from the study. ST was recorded using a smartphone application. Sleep quality was assessed at the end of 30 days using the PSQI questionnaire. Data entry and analysis was done using SPSS v23.0. Results: Total and mean ST were calculated for every participant. The mean screen time of 242 individuals was 147.5051.09 hours. The mean PSQI score was 6.682.3. 65.70% of the participants had a poor sleep quality (PSQI>5). Pearsons correlation revealed that long total ST was associated with decreased sleep quality (R=0.356, p<0.001). Conclusion: Our ndings are in accordance with previous scientific literature largely based on self-reported ST measurements and affirm that excessive ST deteriorates sleep quality and hence has numerous adverse physical and psychological manifestations.

Evidence indicates that high screen time, particularly from smartphones, is associated with poor sleep quality and shorter sleep duration. For instance, a study found that excessive smartphone screen time was linked to a mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 6.68, with 65.7% of participants reporting poor sleep quality (arshad2021adverse, arshad2021adverse_chunk_005). Additionally, a correlation analysis revealed that longer total screen time was associated with decreased sleep quality (R=0.356, p<0.001) (arshad2021adverse, arshad2021adverse_chunk_005).\n\nMoreover, a multilevel model analysis demonstrated that smartphone screen time and unlocks were positively associated with both sleep quality and duration, indicating a nuanced relationship where increased screen time can lead to poorer sleep outcomes (yin2025associations, yin2025associations_chunk_004). Specifically, an inverted U-shaped association was observed between smartphone screen time and sleep duration, suggesting that while some screen time may not be detrimental, excessive use is harmful (yin2025associations, yin2025associations_chunk_004).\n\nFurthermore, a study highlighted that low physical activity combined with high screen time increases the risks of poor sleep quality among college students (arshad2021adverse, arshad2021adverse_chunk_014). This suggests that exercise may mitigate some negative effects of screen time on sleep, although the specific interactions between exercise levels and screen time on sleep outcomes were not detailed in the provided evidence.\n\nIn summary, high screen time negatively impacts sleep quality and duration, while low physical activity exacerbates these effects. However, the evidence does not provide specific quantitative data on how exercise directly interacts with screen time to influence sleep outcomes. To answer this question comprehensively, additional sources covering the specific interactions between exercise and screen time on sleep quality and duration would be needed.", "model": "gpt-4o-mini", "prompt_version": "v1.0_baseline", "metadata": {"num_chunks_retrieved": 5, "prompt_tokens": 3030, "completion_tokens": 408, "total_tokens": 3438}, "query_id": "synth_005", "category": "synthesis", "phase1_task": "general"}

Second, the majority of existing studies of sleep characteristics and inflammation have examined Western populations. A biological necessity, sleep is also a complex behavior influenced by cultural and social factors, such as the encouragement or discouragement of naps, traditional care giving roles, or the amount of time typically devoted to work. Thus, cross-cultural studies may help elucidate disease etiology in settings where the determinants of sleep habits differ (19). Lastly, most studies on sleep characteristics and inflammation have looked at young adult populations, but differences in these relationships may emerge in older populations, among whom chronic disease and higher levels of inflammation are more prevalent (20, 21). It is possible that the mechanisms through which sleep affects inflammatory processes (and vice versa) vary across the life span. In particular, long sleep is most prevalent in those over age 60, and a lengthening of sleep duration may coincide with the aging process and declining health (22-24). Methods Sample Data are from the 2000 and 2006 Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS) of Taiwanese adults ages 53 and over in 2006. All participants were part of the ongoing Taiwan Longitudinal Study of Aging (TLSA) initiated in 1989, with interviews conducted every 3-4 years and with periodic inclusion of younger refresher cohorts (25). In 2000, a demographic and health update, blood and urine specimens, and a medical examination were collected on a subset of respondents (SEBAS I, see (26) for a description). Dowd et al.

Written informed consent was obtained for participation in both the in-home interview and hospital visit in 2000 and 2006; all SEBAS protocols were approved by human subjects committees in Taiwan, and at Georgetown and Princeton Universities.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript Introduction Experimental and observational data indicate that sleep duration and other sleep characteristics are associated with a wide array of health outcomes including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity (1-3). Recent work has begun to investigate the role of inflammation in mediating associations between sleep and health outcomes (4-7). Experimentally, sleep deprivation is associated with acute elevation of both C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)(8, 9), but findings in non-experimental settings have been mixed (5-7, 10-12). Associations between overall sleep quality and inflammatory markers have been more consistent but have still produced diverse findings (13). This paper examined associations between self-reported sleep duration, sleep quality and biomarkers of inflammation in a middle-aged and elderly cohort of Taiwanese adults. Biologically, there are plausible mechanisms linking inflammation and sleep in both causal directions (14). Activation of the autonomic nervous system and elevated", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 1801, "end_char": 4217, "similarity_score": 0.7043215036392212}], "answer": "The provided evidence contains information regarding the relationship between sleep and immune function in older adults, specifically those over 60. \n\n1. **Sleep and Inflammation**: The evidence suggests that \"most studies on sleep characteristics and inflammation have looked at young adult populations,\" indicating a gap in research focused on older adults (dowd2011sleep, dowd2011sleep_chunk_004). However, it is noted that \"differences in these relationships may emerge in older populations, among whom chronic disease and higher levels of inflammation are more prevalent\" (dowd2011sleep, dowd2011sleep_chunk_004). \n\n2. **Long Sleep Duration**: The text mentions that \"long sleep is most prevalent in those over age 60,\" and that this may coincide with the aging process and declining health (dowd2011sleep, dowd2011sleep_chunk_004). This suggests a potential link between sleep duration and health outcomes in older adults.\n\n3. **Inflammatory Markers**: The evidence indicates that sleep duration may be a marker of underlying inflammatory illness in older populations (dowd2011sleep, dowd2011sleep_chunk_005). This implies that sleep characteristics could be associated with immune function, as inflammation is a key component of immune responses.\n\n4. **Biological Mechanisms**: The evidence discusses plausible biological mechanisms linking sleep and inflammation, suggesting that \"activation of the autonomic nervous system and elevated inflammatory markers\" could be involved (dowd2011sleep, dowd2011sleep_chunk_005).\n\nIn summary, while the evidence indicates that sleep characteristics, particularly in older adults, may be related to inflammation and immune function, it primarily highlights the need for further research specifically targeting this demographic.

The study found that better sleep quality was related to lower BMI in women, while men who slept for less than 5 h had a higher BMI than those who slept for 7 h or more. In order to reduce BMI, it may be useful to help men to increase their sleep duration and women to improve their sleep quality. These authors also examined the effect of both sleep quantity and sleep quality in mediating the relationship between perceived discrimination and health, and found that sleep quality rather than sleep duration mediates the unfavorable effect [27]. A meta-analytic study demonstrated that both short and long sleep duration, and dif- culty in maintaining sleep, were associated with a greater risk of type 2 diabetes [71]. From these results, Cappuccio et al. concluded that quantity and quality of sleep consistently and signicantly predicted the risk of the development of type 2 diabetes. The risk varies between 28% in people who report habitual sleep of 56 h per night and 84% in those with difculties in maintaining their sleep. In patients with chronic kidney disease, Ricardo et al. reported that ESS, but not PSQI, was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality [72]. In addition, they found signicant associations between greater sleep fragmentation and an increased risk of end-stage renal disease, and between both greater sleep fragmentation and shorter sleep duration and both a greater decline in estimated glomerular ltration rate and increased protein excretion. From these results, they concluded that short sleep, as well as poor sleep quality, are risk factors for the progression of chronic kidney disease. Taking these reports into consideration, we should emphasize that more attention should be paid to obtaining good quality sleep (restfulness, no sleepiness, no need for more sleep, sufcient objective sleep depth, etc.) in terms of avoiding sleep-related health problems. 10. Sleep Quality in Children and Adolescents So far, studies on sleep quality in children have been limited. As cited before, Falbe et al. [21] demonstrated that sleeping near a small screen was associated with a signicantly poor sleep quality in children of grades 4 and 7. Bruni et al.

While numerous studies have focused on sleep duration, with both short and long sleep durations associated with adverse mental health outcomes (Chunnan, Shaomei, & Wannian, 2022), mounting evidence suggests that other dimensions of sleep may be equally important. Sleep regularity, the day-to-day consistency in sleepwake timing rather than the amount of sleep obtained, has emerged as a potentially critical component of healthy sleep (Windred et al., 2024). The sleep regularity index (SRI), developed by Phillips et al., quantifies the probability of an individual being in the same sleepwake state at any two time points 24 hours apart (Phillips et al., 2017), thus capturing the stability of circadian timing independent of total sleep duration.

They concluded that objective data contribute little to explaining subjective sleep quality. They also assessed a single night of at-home polysomnographic recording of sleep followed by a set of morning questions concerning the prior nights sleep quality in older men (n = 1024) and women (n = 459) [19]. They found that the commonly obtained polysomnographic measures contributed little to the subjective ratings of the prior nights sleep quality. Clark et al. [20] reported that the onset of sleep disturbance predicts a subsequent risk of hypertension and dyslipidemia. The onset of impaired sleep in this study included subjective issues such as difculty in falling asleep, difculty in maintaining sleep, early morning awakening, and non-restorative sleep. Bin [65] wrote a commentary on this article and summarized the main ndings of this report into two statements: 1. Sleep disturbance predicts the occurrence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, and 2. Sleep quality appears a more important risk factor than sleep duration for these disorders. Falbe et al. assessed restfulness by asking the question On how many days in the past week have you felt like you needed more sleep? of 2048 children in grades 4 and 7 [21]. They dened restfulness as having the feeling that more sleep was needed on Children 2021, 8, 542 7 of 13 three days or fewer, based on the notion that perceived restfulness may reect good sleep quality. Sleeping near a small screen, but not a TV, was associated with a signicantly higher prevalence of perceived insufcient restfulness, after adjustment for sleep quantity. This did not vary signicantly by grade, gender, physical activity, or race. As regards the reason why TV presence was not related to less restfulness, they speculated that TV sets do not interrupt sleep when turned off. They also demonstrated the association between a longer screen time and less restfulness. Using feeling fresh after waking-up as a representative issue to assess sleep quality of children, the following factors were shown to affect child sleep quality: gene, par- ent/caregiver, sleep disorders/medical problem, sleep habits/environment/medications, and screen exposure [66].

Epidemiological evi- dence suggests that greater within-person consistency in sleep across nights relates to better health and performance [1], and irregularity in sleepwake patterns has emerged as a prominent risk factor for incident cardiometabolic diseases [24] and car- diovascular events [5]. However, few studies have assessed pro- spective associations of within-person consistency in sleepwake patterns, hereafter referred to as sleep regularity, with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Furthermore, no prior study has compared directly the robustness of mortality risk prediction of sleep regularity versus other important dimensions of sleep, such as sleep duration. In this issue of SLEEP, Windred et al. examined the role of sleep regularity in risk for mortality [6]. Using data from participants in the UK biobank who had completed 7 days of actigraphy during visits conducted between 2013 and 2016, the authors computed a sleep regularity index (SRI) score. Briefly, the SRI provides a gran- ular measure of concordance in patterns of sleep and wake states across days of recording, with higher scores indicative of greater interdaily consistency in sleepwake timing [6, 7]. Among the 60 997 middle-aged to elderly men and women with valid SRI data, 1859 deaths occurred between 2013 and 2021, equating to 4.84 deaths per 1000 person-years. The authors found that greater sleep regularity was associated with significantly lower risk for all-cause mortality.

Studies indicate that sleep disturbances, which can be linked to chronotype, predict health issues such as hypertension and dyslipidemia (kohyama2021which, kohyama2021which_chunk_015). \n\n2. **Sleep Regularity**: The concept of sleep regularity, which captures the consistency of sleep-wake timing, is emerging as an important factor for mental health and overall well-being. Irregular sleep patterns have been associated with adverse health outcomes, including cardiometabolic diseases (zuraikat2024consistency, zuraikat2024consistency_chunk_001). This suggests that individuals with a consistent sleep schedule, which may vary based on their chronotype, could experience better health outcomes.\n\n3. **Chronotype and Glycemic Control**: Research has shown that chronotype is independently associated with glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes, indicating that the timing of sleep relative to one's chronotype can have metabolic implications (kohyama2021which, kohyama2021which_chunk_038).\n\n4. **Circadian Misalignment**: Circadian misalignment, which can occur when an individual's sleep patterns do not align with their biological clock (often influenced by chronotype), has been linked to metabolic dysfunctions, suggesting that evening chronotypes may be at a higher risk for such issues (kohyama2021which, kohyama2021which_chunk_023).\n\nIn summary, chronotype affects sleep outcomes through its influence on sleep quality, regularity, and metabolic health.

While numerous studies have focused on sleep duration, with both short and long sleep durations associated with adverse mental health outcomes (Chunnan, Shaomei, & Wannian, 2022), mounting evidence suggests that other dimensions of sleep may be equally important. Sleep regularity, the day-to-day consistency in sleepwake timing rather than the amount of sleep obtained, has emerged as a potentially critical component of healthy sleep (Windred et al., 2024). The sleep regularity index (SRI), developed by Phillips et al., quantifies the probability of an individual being in the same sleepwake state at any two time points 24 hours apart (Phillips et al., 2017), thus capturing the stability of circadian timing independent of total sleep duration.

In total, the results of 77 participants were analyzed. The participant characteristics are presented in Table 1. Average sleep efficiency based on sleep diaries was negatively correlated with morning WBC and lymphocytes (LYM) values, but not with granulocytes (GRA), monocytes (MON) values, or CRP concentration (Table 2). Additionally, sleep time and sleep latency did not correlate with any of the inflammatory parameters (P > 0.05, Table 2). After a night of sleep (PSG examination), morning WBC values negatively correlated with total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency, REM duration, but not with NREM duration. LYM and MON values did not correlate with PSG parameters (P > 0.05, Table 2). GRA positively correlated with REM latency, negatively with sleep efficiency and REM duration. CRP concentrations negatively correlated only with sleep latency, but not with other PSG parameters (Table 2). Regression analysis showed that WBC values were affected by sleep efficiency calculated on the basis of sleep diaries (B =  0.04, t =  2.92, P = 0.005), but not by PSG parameters (REM durations, number of REM events, sleep efficiency; R2 = 0.10, F = 8.55, P = 0.005).

Tokyo Bay Urayasu Ichikawa Medical Center, Urayasu 279-0001, Japan; j-kohyama@jadecom.or.jp; Tel.: +81-47-351-3101 Abstract: Sleep is one of the basic physiological processes for human survival. Both sleep quantity and sleep quality are fundamental components of sleep. This review looks at both sleep quantity and sleep quality, considering how to manage the complex but probably unavoidable physiological phenomenon of sleep. The need for sleep has marked variations between individuals, in addition to the effects of variable conditions. Studies on sleep quality started later than those on sleep quantity, beginning in 1989 when Ford and Kamerow revealed that insomnia increases the risk of psychiatric disorders. According to the nationwide research team on the quality of sleep (19FA0901), sleep quality is superior to sleep quantity as an index for assessing sleep, and that restfulness obtained through sleep is a useful index for assessing sleep quality. We should pay more attention to obtaining sleep of good quality (restfulness, no sleepiness, no need for more sleep, sufcient objective sleep depth, etc.), although there have not been enough studies on the associations between sleep quality and health or disorders in children and adolescents. Further studies using the deviation from an individuals optimal sleep quantity may show us another aspect of the effects of sleep quantity on various life issues.

One of the factors influencing this effect could be physical activity (PA). The study aimed to assess the impact of deprivation of sleep (DS) on selected inflammatory parameters. Seventy-seven participants completed the protocol consisting of polysomnography (PSG) conducted in a sleep laboratory and DS, monitored with an actigraph. PA was assessed with actigraphy, which categorized participants as active or inactive. White blood cells (WBC) values negatively correlated with sleep efficiency based on sleep diaries and PSG parameters (total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and REM duration), but regression analysis showed that WBC depends only on the sleep diary parameter. Granulocytes (GRA) positively correlated with REM latency, and negatively with sleep efficiency. After DS, all participants exhibited an elevated GRA count. The number of WBC and GRA increased also in the active group; inactive participants showed no changes in inflammatory parameters. The overall number of WBC depends primarily on the quality of sleep over a period of several days. Under the influence of sleep deprivation, the number of GRA increases, but the number of leukocytes depends on the level of physical activity during DS. Keywords Sleep deprivation, Inflammation, C-reactive protein Sleep disorders are a common problem in the general population. It is estimated they affect about 30% of the population1. Deprivation of sleep (DS) is defined as a forced lack of sleep, which might stem from a number of causes, including work, leisure or pain2. Insufficient sleep duration can lead to several systemic complications, including impairment of immunity. In a murine DS model, elevated levels of autoantibodies were observed, which are characteristic of many autoim- mune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus3. Hsiao et al. in their study showed that individuals with sleep disorders have a higher risk of developing the following immune-mediated diseases: systemic lupus ery- thematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spond", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 0, "end_char": 2426, "similarity_score": 0.5739144086837769}, {"chunk_id": "fasokun2026associations_chunk_047", "source_id": "fasokun2026associations", "text": ". 2015;18(10):106877. https:// doi.org/10.1111/ele.12489 PMID: 26248954 55.
