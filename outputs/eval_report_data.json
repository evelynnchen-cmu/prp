      "answer": "The provided evidence indicates several specific findings regarding how sleep duration affects physical health markers related to inflammation:\n\n1. **Long Sleep Duration and Inflammation**: The study found that longer sleep duration (defined as more than 8 hours) was associated with higher levels of inflammation markers such as IL-6 and e-selectin. This association remained significant even after adjusting for various health factors, including waist circumference and self-reported health decline (dowd2011sleep, dowd2011sleep_chunk_001).\n\n2. **Risk of Long Sleep Duration**: Increases in inflammation between 2000 and 2006 were linked to a higher risk of long sleep duration in 2006. Specifically, higher baseline levels of IL-6 and e-selectin predicted long sleep duration six years later, suggesting a potential long-term physiological process rather than just acute illness (dowd2011sleep, dowd2011sleep_chunk_011).\n\n3. **No Association with Short Sleep Duration**: The evidence indicates that there was little to no association between short sleep duration and inflammation markers. Increases in inflammation were specifically associated with long sleep duration, not short sleep duration (dowd2011sleep, dowd2011sleep_chunk_011).\n\n4. **Sample Characteristics**: The study analyzed data from 1,020 respondents aged 53 and over, indicating a focus on older populations. The average reported sleep duration in the sample was 6.4 hours (dowd2011sleep, dowd2011sleep_chunk_004).\n\n5. **Inflammatory Markers Examined**: The study measured several inflammatory markers, including C-Reactive Protein (CRP), IL-6, white blood cell count (WBC), fibrinogen, albumin, e-selectin, and sICAM-1, to assess their relationship with sleep duration (dowd2011sleep, dowd2011sleep_chunk_006).\n\nOverall, the findings suggest that long sleep duration may serve as a marker for underlying inflammatory processes, particularly in older adults, while short sleep duration does not appear to have the same association with inflammation. The evidence does not provide specific statistics on the levels of inflammation associated with long sleep duration beyond the qualitative findings. Further studies would be needed to quantify these relationships more precisely.",

          "text": "-ICAM-1 and decreases (worsening) in albumin between 2000 and 2006 were associated with a higher risk of long but not short sleep duration in 2006 (Table 4). Higher baseline levels of IL-6 and e- selectin also predicted long sleep duration six years later independent of the change in levels, while higher baseline levels of sICAM-1 predicted short sleep duration. Given the six-year period between measurement of inflammation and sleep duration, these results suggest that the contemporaneous inflammation-long sleep duration association may not be driven solely by acute illness but likely reflects longer-term physiological processes. Discussion From our cross-sectional data, we found virtually no relationship between biomarkers of inflammation and the overall sleep quality index or its subcomponents. In contrast, we found a strong relationship between long sleep duration and most markers of inflammation, with little evidence of associations between short sleep duration and inflammation. Increases in inflammation between 2000 and 2006, determined from longitudinal data, were associated with an increased relative risk of long sleep duration in 2006, with no association found for Dowd et al. Page 5 Ann Epidemiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 November 1. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript short sleep duration. This result may support the hypothesis that high inflammation is related to long sleep duration via the worsening of co-morbidities associated with inflammation. This work is consistent with some, but not all, previous research on inflammation and sleep. For example, Okun et al. (2009) found that poor sleep quality as measured by the PSQI was associated with higher CRP but not with IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) in a sample of 43 young U.S. women, with no associations between inflammatory markers and sleep duration as measured continuously, consistent with our primarily negative findings for sleep quality and continuous sleep duration(5). Friedman et al. (2005) identified relationships between IL-6 and the PSQI global score at the bivariate level but not after adjustment for sociodemographic factors in a sample of 74 U.S. women aged 61-90 (7). Better sleep efficiency, as measured by the in-home NightCap monitoring system, was related to significantly lower levels of IL-6 in this sample. McDade et al. (2006) found higher CRP in those reporting taking longer than 30 minutes to fall asleep,",

          "text": " not mediated by measures of chronic conditions in our sample, it is possible that unmeasured disease processes with an inflammatory component are a source of both inflammation and long sleep duration. This explanation would be consistent with our findings that increases in inflammation between waves predicted long sleep duration in the second wave, and broader findings in the literature of an association between long sleep and mortality. An additional limitation is that self-reported sleep quality and duration are likely measured with error, which could contribute to our null findings for the PSQI sleep components and inflammation. Objective monitoring methods such as wrist- watch actigraphy have recently beenemployed in population surveys to measure more precisely various aspects of sleep quality and sleep duration (48). Our study contributes to the sparse literature on long sleep duration and inflammation, which may be particularly salient for older populations. The current study's strengths include a large sample size compared with previous studies, an extensive array of inflammatory markersincluding measures of change for most markers-- and one of the first investigations of these associations in a non-Western sample. Afternoon naps are customary among the elderly in Taiwan, with some evidence suggesting that nappers have better nocturnal sleep quality(49). Since the PSQI asks only about nighttime sleep duration, it is possible that total sleep duration is longer than reported, making short nighttime sleep duration less detrimental and longer nighttime sleep duration a stronger indicator of poor health. Future work on sleep duration and inflammation should move beyond an exclusive focus on short sleep and examine the potential importance of long sleep as a marker of underlying inflammatory illness. Prospective studies of sleep and inflammatory markers can help shed light on whether these relationships are causal or are driven by other factors. Such studies could also help elucidate the role of inflammation in the observed association between long sleep and mortality, contributing to our understanding of sleep as both a cause and consequence of ill health.

Inflammation may play a role in mediating these associations. MethodsWe examined associations between inflammation and self-reported sleep characteristics in 1020 respondents of the 2000 and 2006 Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS), a nationally representative survey of Taiwanese adults ages 53 and over. Regression models were used to estimate cross-sectional relationships between inflammation (IL-6, CRP, fibrinogen, e-selectin, sICAM-1, albumin, and WBC) and a modified Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), index subcomponents, and self-reported sleep duration. Change in inflammatory markers between 2000 and 2006 was also used to predict long or short sleep duration in 2006. ResultsInflammation was not related to the overall index of sleep quality. However, longer sleep (> 8 hours) was associated with higher levels of inflammation. These associations remained after adjustment for waist circumference, self-reported health decline, diabetes, arthritis/ rheumatism, heart disease, and depressive symptoms. Increases in inflammation between 2000 and 2006 were associated with long but not short sleep duration in 2006 for several markers. ConclusionsLong sleep duration may be a marker of underlying inflammatory illness in older populations.

Statistical Analysis First, we estimated linear regression models with each inflammatory marker as an outcome to examine cross-sectional associations between individual markers and the overall modified PSQI as well as the five PSQI sleep components, adjusted for age and sex. PSQI subcomponents were entered linearly (0-3); results were similar when scores were used as indicator variables. Linear probability regression models were run for the dichotomous CRP variables, the overall inflammation index, and the dichotomous indicator of high overall inflammation (results using logit models for binary outcomes were very similar). Next, we ran analogous models for each inflammatory marker using a categorical measure of sleep duration (<6 hours, 6-8 hours, >8 hours) as the predictor, with and without adjustment for potential health mediators. Finally, because of the possibility that inflammation can promote sleep (18), we tested whether increases in inflammation between Dowd et al. Page 4 Ann Epidemiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 November 1. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript 2000 and 2006 predicted sleep duration in 2006. This analysis included all markers except fibrinogen (which was collected only in 2006), and was based on respondents who participated in both waves (n=639). For each biomarker, we used a multinomial logit model with sleep duration coded categorically as the dependent variable, adjusted for age, sex and baseline inflammation levels. Because some studies have found sex differences in relationships between inflammation and sleep (13, 43), we also tested for interactions by sex; these interactions were not statistically significant and thus were not included in our final models. Results The average age of the sample was 66 years, with 6.4 average hours of reported sleep (Table 1). Overall, there were few associations between the inflammatory markers and the PSQI subcomponents or the overall PSQI (Table 2). There were no significant associations for CRP, IL-6, fibrinogen, WBC, or albumin. sICAM-1 showed marginally significant positive associations with the overall index (p0.057), sleep efficiency (p0.092), and a significant association with the index measure of short sleep duration (p.012).

The overall (shortened) PSQI was a sum of the five subcomponents, with a range of (0-15). In accordance with the traditional PSQI scale, sleep duration was coded categorically (0=7 hours, 1=6 to <7 hours, 2=5 to <6 hours, and 3=<5 hours). Because of potential associations between both long and short sleep duration and health outcomes, we also categorized sleep duration as <6 hours, 6-8 hours, and >8 hours for separate non-linear analyses. Inflammatory markers Inflammatory markers were assayed from overnight fasting serum samples. We examined all inflammation-related markers measured in SEBAS I and II: C-Reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), white blood cell count (WBC), fibrinogen (SEBAS II only), albumin, e- selectin, and sICAM-1; measures of IL-6, e-selectin, sICAM-1, and CRP for SEBAS I were derived from frozen specimens collected in 2000 and assayed between 2007 and 2009. CRP, an acute phase protein, is an important component of the non-specific innate immune system response to infection and injury and is often used as a general marker of systemic inflammation (32, 33). IL-6 is the primary inflammatory cytokine responsible for upregulation of CRP (34). Fibrinogen is an acute phase protein that plays an important role 1The original PSQI contains two additional subcomponents: sleep disturbances and use of sleep medication (30). Subsequent research has shown that the sleep medication component is not significantly associated with the global PSQI score, and sleep disturbances had a low correlation with the global score (31).

Conclusions Both sleep quantity and sleep quality are fundamental components of sleep. Since there are marked inter-individual differences in the need for sleep, sleep quantity might be assessed not by actual duration but by a deviation from the individuals own optimal sleep quantity. For sleep quality, no standardized scale has been established, probably because sleep quality has many aspects. The variables for sleep quality can be selected depending on the purpose of the study. At present, many studies have decided that sleep quality, rather than sleep quantity, is favorable for reecting health or functioning issues. However, these studies used actual values for sleep quantity. Further studies using the deviation from an individuals own optimal sleep quantity may show us another aspect of the effects of sleep quantity on various life issues.

While numerous studies have focused on sleep duration, with both short and long sleep durations associated with adverse mental health outcomes (Chunnan, Shaomei, & Wannian, 2022), mounting evidence suggests that other dimensions of sleep may be equally important. Sleep regularity, the day-to-day consistency in sleepwake timing rather than the amount of sleep obtained, has emerged as a potentially critical component of healthy sleep (Windred et al., 2024). The sleep regularity index (SRI), developed by Phillips et al., quantifies the probability of an individual being in the same sleepwake state at any two time points 24 hours apart (Phillips et al., 2017), thus capturing the stability of circadian timing independent of total sleep duration.

Additionally, sleep time and sleep latency did not correlate with any of the inflammatory parameters (P > 0.05, Table 2). After a night of sleep (PSG examination), morning WBC values negatively correlated with total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency, REM duration, but not with NREM duration.

Tokyo Bay Urayasu Ichikawa Medical Center, Urayasu 279-0001, Japan; j-kohyama@jadecom.or.jp; Tel.: +81-47-351-3101 Abstract: Sleep is one of the basic physiological processes for human survival. Both sleep quantity and sleep quality are fundamental components of sleep. This review looks at both sleep quantity and sleep quality, considering how to manage the complex but probably unavoidable physiological phenomenon of sleep. The need for sleep has marked variations between individuals, in addition to the effects of variable conditions. Studies on sleep quality started later than those on sleep quantity, beginning in 1989 when Ford and Kamerow revealed that insomnia increases the risk of psychiatric disorders. According to the nationwide research team on the quality of sleep (19FA0901), sleep quality is superior to sleep quantity as an index for assessing sleep, and that restfulness obtained through sleep is a useful index for assessing sleep quality. We should pay more attention to obtaining sleep of good quality (restfulness, no sleepiness, no need for more sleep, sufcient objective sleep depth, etc.), although there have not been enough studies on the associations between sleep quality and health or disorders in children and adolescents. Further studies using the deviation from an individuals optimal sleep quantity may show us another aspect of the effects of sleep quantity on various life issues.

One of the factors influencing this effect could be physical activity (PA). The study aimed to assess the impact of deprivation of sleep (DS) on selected inflammatory parameters. Seventy-seven participants completed the protocol consisting of polysomnography (PSG) conducted in a sleep laboratory and DS, monitored with an actigraph. PA was assessed with actigraphy, which categorized participants as active or inactive. White blood cells (WBC) values negatively correlated with sleep efficiency based on sleep diaries and PSG parameters (total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and REM duration), but regression analysis showed that WBC depends only on the sleep diary parameter. Granulocytes (GRA) positively correlated with REM latency, and negatively with sleep efficiency. After DS, all participants exhibited an elevated GRA count. The number of WBC and GRA increased also in the active group; inactive participants showed no changes in inflammatory parameters. The overall number of WBC depends primarily on the quality of sleep over a period of several days. Under the influence of sleep deprivation, the number of GRA increases, but the number of leukocytes depends on the level of physical activity during DS. Keywords Sleep deprivation, Inflammation, C-reactive protein Sleep disorders are a common problem in the general population. It is estimated they affect about 30% of the population1. Deprivation of sleep (DS) is defined as a forced lack of sleep, which might stem from a number of causes, including work, leisure or pain2. Insufficient sleep duration can lead to several systemic complications, including impairment of immunity. In a murine DS model, elevated levels of autoantibodies were observed, which are characteristic of many autoim- mune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus3. Hsiao et al. in their study showed that individuals with sleep disorders have a higher risk of developing the following immune-mediated diseases: systemic lupus ery- thematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spond",
