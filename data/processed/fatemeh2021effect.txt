We summarized evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that investigated the effects of melatonin on sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in adults with various diseases. Methods The literature searches of English publications in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were performed up June 2020. Results were summarized as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random effects model (DerSimonianLaird method). Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated by the Cochrane Q test and I-squared (I2). To determine the predefined sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analysis was performed. Results Of 2642 papers, 23 RCTs met inclusion criteria. Our results indicated that melatonin had significant effect on sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (WMD:  1.24; 95% CI  1.77,  0.71, p = 0.000). There was significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 80.7%, p = 0.000). Subgroup analysis based on health status and kind of intervention were potential between-study heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis based on health status revealed melatonin intervention in subjects with Respiratory diseases (WMD:  2.20; 95% CI  2.97,  1.44, p = 0.000), Metabolic disorders (WMD:  2.74; 95% CI  3.48,  2.00, p = 0.000) and sleep disorders (WMD:  0.67; 95% CI  0.98,  0.37, p = 0.000) has significant effect on sleep quality. Conclusion We found that the treatment with exogenous melatonin has positive effects on sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in adult. In adults with respiratory diseases, metabolic disorders, primary sleep dis- orders, not with mental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and other diseases. Keywords Melatonin  Sleep quality  PSQI  Meta-analysis Introduction Sleep as a physiological and behavioral process is essential for body regulation and quality of life at any age[1]. Nowa- days, sleep quality is often declined, and sleep deprivation or restriction causes several physiological and behavioral changes.[2] Inadequate sleep, in terms of either quantity or quality, is a known risk factor for several diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, vascular disorders, metabolic dysfunction and neurocognitive and leading to an increase in mortality and create a substantial burden on the health care system [36]. Also, the sleep distur- bance causes clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning [7]. Almost a third of the worlds population suffers from sleep disorders, mainly insomnia, because of stressful working conditions and aging and these disorders are more com- mon in women and the elderly [8]. Current medications have substantial adverse events, such as excessive day- time sleepiness, poor tolerance to the medication, cogni- tive impairment, dependency and withdrawal [9]. Due to these side effects, there has been an increased interest to find a new pharmaceutical with less side effects and non- pharmaceutical approach such as yoga, physical exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, acupuncture, mindfulness, * Mirzaei Khadijeh mirzaei_kh@sina.tums.ac.ir 1 Department of Community Nutrition, School of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), P.O Box 6446, 14155 Tehran, Iran 2 Department of Clinical Nutrition, School of Nutrition and Food Science, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran 206 Journal of Neurology (2022) 269:205216 1 3 and nutritional therapy to promote better sleep quality [10]. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is an endogenous indoleamine that is produced nocturnally by the pineal gland and released into the bloodstream exclu- sively at night following the circadian rhythm. Melatonin is a sleep regulator and signal of darkness in humans [11]. Some randomized, placebo-controlled trials indicated that melatonin intervention cannot improve quality of sleep [12, 13]. However, some of the recent findings published suggest that melatonin is a potent drug candidate for sleep disorders [14, 15]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive review on the efficacy of mela- tonin intervention for the improvement of sleep quality as assessed by the PSQI in different disease. Thus, with accumulating evidence, we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate the roles of exogenous melatonin, versus placebo, in the treatment of sleep quality sleep quality as assessed by the PSQI in adult with various disease. Methods The present meta-analysis was reported based on the Pre- ferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analysis (PRISMA) statement guideline [16]. The PICOS- model [17], where the acronym PICOS stands for population (all individuals except children under 18 years old and preg- nant and lactating women), intervention (melatonin supple- mentation), comparison (studies which had control group), outcome (studies that reported. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and study design that were randomized controlled trial (RCT) were used. Search strategy A throughout search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Embase and Google Scholar from inception to June 2020 with no time restriction. Only articles published in English were considered in this review. We used medical subject headings (MeSH) and text words to identify the potential interest studies. Search words included: Melatonin OR "Melatonin supplementation" AND Sleep OR "Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders" OR "Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic" OR "Sleep Wake Disorders" OR "Men- tal Health" OR sleep* OR "sleep quality" OR mental health" OR "Pittsburgh sleep quality index". We hand searched all reference lists of eligible articles, related reviews, and meta- analyses to prevent missing any relevant studies. Unpub- lished documents and grey literature like conference papers, theses, and patents were not included. Eligibility criteria The included studies in this meta-analysis were as follows: (1) randomized control trials (RCT), (2) only executed on adult population (aged > 18 years) and (3) reported sleep quality as assessed by PSQI. Literature excluded if they met the following criteria: (1) they were study design except RCT (2) had studies the effects of melatonin along with other interventions (3) had lack of sufficient data for the outcomes of interest in individuals and (4) studies carried out with less than 2 weeks follow-ups. Data extraction Two independent researchers (F. GH., N. R.) extracted the data for this meta-analysis, evaluated the quality of eligible studies, and performed double-checks. Any disagreements and differences were resolved by a third independent investi- gator (Kh-M), if necessary. The following data from the full text of selected studies were extracted: first authors name, year of publication, study location, study duration, gender, mean age and mean body mass index (BMI) of participants, study design, the health status of the study population, number of participants in each group, dose of melatonin supplementation and outcome results (means and standard deviations for PSQI before and after intervention). Statistical analysis The effect of melatonin on sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was estimated by pooling mean and standard deviation (SD) values of the baseline and the end of the studies in both intervention and control groups. If the studies did not report mean and SD, we used the following formula to calculate missing SDs for changes: SD change = square root [(SD baseline2 + SD final2)(2  R  SD baseline  SD final)]. We considered a correlation coefficient of 0.9 as the R-value of the men- tioned formula (18). Standard errors (SE) were converted to SD according to the formula of SE  n. If a study pro- vided medians (interquartile ranges), we converted them to means (SD) as described by Hozo and colleagues [19]. If the study results reported graphically, we used Get Data Graph Digitizer software to estimated mean (SD). At first, a fixed-effect model was performed to pool the data. The het- erogeneity was substantially significant when the Cochrane Q test showed a p value < 0.1 and I2 statistic provided the relative amount of variance of the summary effect. In case of heterogeneity, a random effects model by DerSimonian and Laird method [20] was applied. To evaluate the predefined sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analysis as performed 207 Journal of Neurology (2022) 269:205216 1 3 based on baseline BMI, dose of Melatonin, study duration, age, health status, kind of intervention and gender. Publica- tion bias was evaluated using Eggers regression test and Beggs rank correlation tests [21, 22]. Meta-analysis was carried out using Stata software, version 14 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Results Selected studies The initial search identified 2642 publications through Sco- pus, PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar. Then, we iden- tified 284 duplication records. After excluding duplicates, a total of 2358 studies were retrieved for title and abstract screening. After screening for title and abstract, 2324 arti- cles were excluded and 34 papers were retrieved for full text review. Out of 34 retrieved papers, 11 articles were excluded due to report different unit [12, 23, 24], without sufficient data [13, 25], complex intervention [2630] or overlapped by chosen studies [31]. Finally, 23 papers [3254] were eli- gible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. The flow chart of literature search is shown in Fig. 1. Quality assessment We used Cochrane scoring system to assess the quality of the included studies. The risk of bias is assessed by seven crite- ria which are as follows: random sequence generation, allo- cation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other biases. Studies were stratified as low risk of bias, high risk of bias or unclear regarding each criterion.

Allocation concealment reported in 21 trials [3245, 47, 4954] and the remainder showed an unclear risk of bias [46, 48]. Nineteen trials showed low risk of bias in terms of blinding of participants and personnel [3239, 4147, 5154]. Seven publications had low risk of bias regard- ing blinding of outcome assessment [3235, 41, 53, 54]. Selective reporting considered as low risk in 17 trials [3336, 3840, 42, 4450, 53, 54] and high risk in 5 tri- als[37, 41, 43, 51, 52]. Except for two studies [38, 39], the rest of the studies showed low risk of bias based on incomplete outcome [3237, 4054]. 17 publications illus- trated low risk of bias based on other potential threats to validity [3238, 4045, 47, 49, 53, 54]. Details of risk of bias assessment are described in Table 1. Studies characteristics Eventually, we identified 23 trials that assessed the effects of melatonin on sleep quality. Included studies carried out in various countries such as Iran [32, 36, 37, 41, 52, 53], USA [50, 51], Denmark [49], Brazil [34, 44, 46], Korea [39], UK [40, 43, 47, 48], Mexico [47], South Korea [45], Singapore [38], Sri Lanka [35], Canada [33], Norway [42], Australia [54]. Publication dates ranged from 2004 and 2020. The follow-up period ranged from 2 to 24 weeks. The sample size of the included studies ranged from 16 to 711 participants. Some studies enrolled only males [32, 41] and females [34, 42, 5052] and the rest of included studies involved both genders [33, 3540, 4349, 53, 54]. Types of melatonin administration were melatonin [3238, 41, 42, 44, 46, 47, 5053] and Prolonged-release melatonin [39, 40, 43, 45, 48, 49, 54] among included studies. Study dose varied between 2 and 10 mg melatonin. 23 studies were conducted Table 1 Cochrane risk of bias assessment Abbreviations: L, low risk of bias; H, high risk of bias; U, unclear risk of bias Study Random Sequence Generation Allocation Concealment Blinding of participants and personnel Blinding of outcome assess- ment Incomplete outcome data Selective outcome reporting Other sources of bias Overall quality Mousavi et al U L L L L U L Good Gendy et al U L L L L L L Good Campos et al U L L L L L L Good De Silva et al U L L L L L L Good Halvani et al U L L U L L L Good Ostadmohammadi et al L L L U L H L Good Song et al U L L U U L L Good Jun et al U L L U U L U Fair Wade et al.

The studies performed in subjects with different baseline BMI; six studies carried out in subjects under 25 kg/m2 [34, 36, 39, 41, 44, 45], nine studies over than 25 kg/m2 [32, 37, 40, 42, 48, 5154] and nine studies did not report BMI [33, 35, 38, 43, 46, 47, 49, 50]. 20 stud- ies were parallel randomized clinical trial and three studies were cross over randomized clinical trial. The summary of the main features of the included studies is shown in Table 2. Metaanalysis Effect of melatonin on sleep quality Overall, 23 clinical trials evaluated the effect of melatonin on PSQI. Pooled effect size from random effect model showed a significant lowering effect of melatonin on PSQI (WMD:  1.24; 95% CI  1.77,  0.71, p = 0.000). There was significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 80.7%, p = 0.000) (Fig. 2). We observed that subgroup analysis based on health status could explain potential between study heteroge- neity. Also, we observed that subgroup analysis based on kind of intervention (melatonin vs prolonged-release melatonin) were another source of heterogeneity, because heterogeneity decreased below 50%. Both of intervention improved sleep quality significantly [melatonin: (WMD:  1.52; 95% CI  2.34,  0.70, p = 0.000) and prolonged- release melatonin (WMD:  0.71; 95% CI  1.21,  0.21 p = 0.006)]. Subgroup analysis based on baseline BMI, dose of melatonin, study duration, age, and gender showed no significant differences between subgroups (Table 3). Sub- group analysis based on health status revealed that subjects with respiratory diseases (WMD:  2.20; 95% CI  2.97,  1.44, p = 0.000), metabolic disorders (WMD:  2.74; 95% CI  3.48,  2.00, p = 0.000) and sleep disorders ( WMD:  0.67; 95% CI  0.98,  0.37, p = 0.000) without significant heterogeneity and score of PSQI significantly decreased following melatonin supplementation; but there was not any significant effect in mental disorders (p = 0.648), neurodegenerative diseases (p = 0.132), and other disease (p = 0.224). Also, subgroup analysis revealed that both doses ( 3 mg and > 3 mg) decreased score of PSQI significantly [ 3 mg (WMD:  0.87; 95% CI  1.38,  0.35, p = 0.005) and > 3 mg (WMD:  2.03; 95% CI  3.11, -0.96, p = 0.001]. Publication bias and sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis indicated that removing any of the studies could not substantially change the effect of melatonin on PSQI (Fig. 3). Assessment of publication bias by visual inspection of funnel plot indicated no evidence of publica- tion bias in the meta-analysis of melatonin intervention on sleep quality (Fig. 4). Eggers weighted regression tests also were performed to explore the publication bias. There was no evidence of publication bias for studies examining the effect of melatonin on PSQI (p = 0.293, Eggers test, and p = 0.882, Beggs test). Discussion In the current study, we proved a significant improvement in sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) by melatonin supplementation based on the random-effects model in adult populations. Some previous meta-analyses assess the effect of melatonin on sleep quality in special disease such as primary sleep disorders, secondary sleep disorder, chronic kidney diseases. Sleep disturbance (SD), unsatisfactory sleep, and altered sleep patterns are common among patients with various diseases which may result in decreasing quality of life. To the best of our knowl- edge, this study is the first meta-analysis that investigated the effect of melatonin on sleep quality as measured by the PSQI in adults with various diseases. However, there was evidence of between-study heterogeneity in this regard. We found participants health status was the potential source of heterogeneity. Based on subgroup analysis, there were sig- nificant effects of melatonin supplementation on sleep qual- ity in subjects with respiratory diseases, metabolic disorders, and sleep disorders, but in subjects with mental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, other diseases such as breast cancer, migraine, patients under MMT, alcohol use disorder, cirrhosis, IBS, brain injury, did not show any significant effect. Besides, we observed that subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention was another source of heterogeneity however, both interventions improved sleep quality signifi- cantly. Also, we found that both doses ( 3 mg and > 3 mg) increased sleep quality significantly. Melatonin is an important endogenous indoleamine that is synthesized and secreted into the systemic circulation and cerebrospinal fluid by the pineal gland. It has a substan- tial role to regulate the circadian rhythm and sleep during the night. It has also been suggested that melatonin may act to facilitate sleep by inhibiting the circadian drive for waking that comes from the suprachiasmatic nucleus [55]. 210 Journal of Neurology (2022) 269:205216 1 3 Table 2 Characteristics of included studies Author Country Year Study design Population Gender Sample size (inter- vention/ control) Mean age (interven- tion/control) Intervention Duration (weeks) Daily dose (mg) Study result Chen et al US 2014 Parallel Breast cancer Woman 39 41 59 59 Melatonin 16 3 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Kotlarczyk et al US 2012 Parallel Perimenopausal women Woman 13 5 50.3 47.5 Melatonin 24 3 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Gendy et al Canada 2020 Parallel Alcohol use disorder Mix 30 30 _ _ Melatonin 4 5 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Campos et al Brazil 2004 Parallel Asthma Woman 11 10 27 32.4 Melatonin 4 3 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score De Silva et al Sri Lanka 2020 Cross-over Cirrhosis Mix 37 34 63.6 60.1 Melatonin 4 3 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Halvani et al Iran 2013 Parallel COPD Mix 23 25 65.7 66.85 Melatonin 4 3 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Ostadmohammadi et al Iran 2019 Parallel Diabetic HD Mix 26 27 65.6 64.1 Melatonin 12 10 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Song et al Singapore 2005 Parallel IBS Mix 20 20 27.15 27.7 Melatonin 2 3 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Nunes et al Brazil 2008 Parallel COPD Mix 12 13 64.17 67.38 Melatonin 3 3 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Baandrup et al Denmark 2016 Parallel Schizophrenia or bipo- lar disorder Mix 28 27 48.8 49.1 PRM 24 2 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Shabania et al Iran 2018 Parallel PCOS Woman 29 29 26.5 26 Melatonin 12 10 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Mousavia et al Iran 2016 Parallel SM-injured patient Man 15 15 51.46 51.66 Melatonin 8 3 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Jun et al Korea 2018 Parallel RBD Mix 7 9 68.1 66.4 PRM 4 2 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Jun et al Korea 2018 Parallel RBD Mix 9 9 64.7 66.4 PRM 4 6 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Wade et al UK 2007 Parallel Insomnia Mix 169 165 66.1 65.3 PRM 3 2 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Ghaderi et al Iran 2018 Parallel Patients under MMT Man 26 28 42.5 42.7 melatonin 12 10 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Wade et al UK, USA 2014 Parallel Alzheimer Mix 31 29 75.3 75.3 PRM 24 2 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Medeiros et al Brazil 2006 Parallel Parkinson Mix 8 10 62.9 60.7 Melatonin 4 3 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score 211 Journal of Neurology (2022) 269:205216 1 3 Melatonin levels decrease with age, so older adults are more prone to suffer from inadequate melatonin levels [56]. There- fore, the incidences of sleep disturbance increase with age. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an efficient tool for measuring the quality and patterns of sleep. It has been recommended as the main measure for global sleep and insomnia symptoms in recent expert consensus recom- mendations for a standard set of research assessments in insomnia [57]. This questionnaire has seven components to measure sleep quality and it differentiates poor from good sleep: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month [58]. That should be noted that a higher PSQI score indicates a lower sleep quality. This review has focused on the effects of melatonin on sleep quality using the PSQI questionnaire in adult patients and showed that melatonin intervention can improve sleep quality. In line with our findings, Auld et al. [59] conducted a similar meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of melatonin in adult with primary sleep disorders. Although our analysis focused on subjects with any sleep disorders, Auld et al. revealed that exogenous melatonin reduces sleep onset latency in primary insomnia and DSPS and regulates the sleepwake patterns in blind patients. In another meta-analysis, Li et al. investigated the roles of melatonin supplementation for the treatment of secondary sleep disorders. Li et al.[14] demonstrated that melatonin improves sleep quality concerning sleep onset latency and total sleep time. However, Li et al. showed melatonin has no actions on the sleep efficiency of patients with secondary sleep disorders. Also, Zhang et al.[60] conducted a meta- analysis that investigated melatonin for sleep disorders in neurodegenerative disease and found melatonin improved sleep quality significantly, which is consistent with our results, but no significant effects were detected for objective sleep outcomes (total nocturnal sleep time (TNST), sleep efficiency, and the number of night-time awakenings). In contrast, a meta-analysis by Buscemi et al.[61] reported that melatonin supplementation in people who had sleep dis- orders with sleep restriction is not effective on sleep onset latency and found that melatonin has no effect in reliving sleep problems. Additionally, some randomized, placebo- controlled trials indicated that melatonin intervention cannot improve the quality of sleep [12, 13]. In the current meta-analysis, we used one questioner to measure sleep quality, so, it can enhance the reliability of our results. Our study in subgroup analysis found that health status was the main source of heterogeneity. We found that melatonin was effective in respiratory diseases, metabolic disorders and primary sleep disorders, not in mental dis- orders, neurodegenerative disorders, and other diseases. It might be explained by different levels of sleep disturbances COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, MMT methadone maintenance treatment, RBD rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, SM-injured sulfur mustard lung injuries, HD hemodi- alysis, PCOS polycystic ovary syndrome, PRM prolonged-release melatonin Table 2 (continued) Author Country Year Study design Population Gender Sample size (inter- vention/ control) Mean age (interven- tion/control) Intervention Duration (weeks) Daily dose (mg) Study result Morales-Delgado et al Mexico 2018 Parallel Dementia Mix 16 15 82.2 83.1 Melatonin 8 5 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Wade et al UK 2011 Parallel Primary insomnia Mix 358 353 61.9 61.5 PRM 3 2 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Alstadhaug et al Norway 2010 Cross-over Migraine Woman 22 24 42.3 42.3 Melatonin 16 2 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Ahn et al South Korea 2019 Parallel Parkinson Mix 16 18 66 64.6 PRM 4 2 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Grima et al Australia 2018 Cross-over Brain injury Mix 18 15 35 38 PRM 4 weeks 2 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Daneshvar Kakhakia et al Iran 2019 Parallel Parkinson Mix 25 26 64.4 66.3 Melatonin 12 weeks 10 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score 212 Journal of Neurology (2022) 269:205216 1 3 in these patients who may have a better response to mela- tonin. Also, some of the enrolled participants in two RCTs have already been experiencing _good_ sleep and some patients in these studies did not have insomnia, therefore, participants had heterogeneous symptoms of sleep disor- ders. However, an improvement in sleep quality was found in most of them. The etiology of sleep disorders is complex, involving multiple molecular mechanisms, so melatonin may be improving some aspect of sleep and it could be another reason for the lack of significant effect of melatonin in these subjects. Furthermore, some RCTs included in these subgroups had only a few participants, which may not be representa- tive of the large population afflicted by these sleep disor- ders. Besides, we observed that subgroup analysis based on kind of intervention (melatonin vs prolonged-release melatonin) could be another source of heterogeneity. Moreover, both melatonin and prolonged-release mela- tonin had a significant effect on sleep quality. Melatonin is tolerated well, unlike other sleeping medication melatonin has not high potential for dependence [62]. There is little evidence of substantial adverse events from long-term use of melatonin, and it can take many years for symptoms of toxicity to develop [63]. Using 20100 mg/day melatonin orally in healthy subjects has no significant side effects with no important alterations to any physiological or bio- chemical measures [64]. Some studies demonstrated that long-term use of melatonin is well tolerated, without any crucial side effect [31, 48, 65]. However, there are con- cerns about chronic use of melatonin, in large doses it may interact with other medications [66]. Limitations The current study has some limitations. Most analyses had high levels of heterogeneity, but this is expected because included studies had participants with different health con- ditions or doses and duration. Additionally, there were not enough studies to evaluate sleep problems in some dis- eases. Moreover, our search was limited to published Eng- lish studies. Also, in this study, we used the PSQI global score to assess sleep quality, it seems that it is better to evaluate PSQI components separately.

This significant effect was also seen in subjects with respiratory diseases, metabolic dis- orders, and primary sleep disorders, but there was not any significant effect on mental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and other diseases.
