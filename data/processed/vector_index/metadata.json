This study aimed to explore this association using data from a large, nationally representative sample of US adults. Methods: Data from 13,476 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 20072012 were analyzed. Weighted robust Poisson regression models were employed to assess the relationship between sleep duration and anxiety, with additional subgroup analyses conducted to explore variations across different demographic groups. Results: Among participants, 25.8% exhibited symptoms of anxiety. Compared to normal sleep duration (79 hours), very short sleep durations (<5 hours) and short sleep durations (5 to <7 hours) were significantly linked to higher anxiety risks, with adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 1.40 (95% CI [1.231.59]) and 1.17 (95% CI [1.091.25]), respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed that shorter sleep durations were more strongly associated with anxiety in males, older adults, racial minorities, and married individuals compared to their counterparts.

Conclusion: Short sleep duration is associated with an increased risk of anxiety, with the strength of this association differing notably across demographic subgroups. Long sleep duration is associated with higher anxiety risk exclusively in specific groups, including non-married individuals and younger adults. Further research is needed to uncover the mechanisms underlying these associations. Keywords: sleep duration, anxiety, NHANES, mental health, cross-sectional study Introduction Anxiety disorders, affecting approximately 34% of the US population, are among the most prevalent mental health issues worldwide.1 These disorders not only cause significant distress and functional impairment but also frequently co-occur with other mental health conditions and a range of physiological disorders, including neurological, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal diseases.26 Given their widespread prevalence and profound impact, it is crucial to investigate the underlying mechanisms of anxiety disorders to develop targeted prevention and intervention strategies. Sleep is fundamental for cognitive and emotional well-being,7 with disturbances in sleep closely linked to mental health disorders, particularly anxiety.8,9 Recent research has increasingly focused on the relationship between sleep duration and anxiety. A meta-analysis revealed that individuals with anxiety disorders often experience reduced total sleep time.10 Similarly, a cross-sectional survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic indicated that non- hospitalized individuals who slept seven or more hours per night exhibited a significantly lower anxiety incidence than those who slept less than seven hours.11 Additionally, a cohort study in Korea found that sleeping between seven to nine hours, as opposed to six hours per day, effectively reduced the likelihood of future anxiety symptoms.12 Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2025:18 11551167 1155  2025 Wang et al.

For instance, it relies on limited population groups, which significantly restricts the generalizability of its findings to more diverse populations,17 such as the US population examined in the current study. Therefore, the association between short sleep duration and anxiety warrants further investigation across culturally and demographically diverse populations. Regarding longer sleep duration, some studies suggest that sleep exceeding nine hours does not increase the risk of anxiety.12 Likewise, the above Mendelian randomization study has not supported a causal relationship between extended sleep duration and anxiety.16 Nevertheless, other research has found that, compared to seven hours or seven to nine hours of sleep, longer sleep duration (10 hours) is significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety.1820 Therefore, the relationship between long sleep duration and anxiety also warrants further exploration.

Notably, existing studies have identified the influence of factors such as age, marital status, and socio-economic status on anxiety within the American population. Anxiety levels among Americans increased significantly over the decade from 2008 to 2018, with the most significant increase in younger adults (1825 years).21 Compared to peers, individuals who had never been married or had attained higher education levels experienced greater increases in anxiety.21 White, Hispanic/Latino, and Native American individuals have higher rates of anxiety disorder diagnoses compared to Black individuals.22 During the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds reported greater health and economic concerns, along with higher anxiety levels.23 Furthermore, these demographic factors may also interact with sleep patterns, potentially modifying the relationship between sleep and mental health. For example, adolescents from high-income families experience fewer negative health effects from poor sleep quality.24 Positive parent-child relationships have been shown to amplify the mental health benefits of good sleep.25 Physical activity moderates the relationship between sleep and emotional distress, although this effect was significant only among White populations.26 Additionally, sleep disturbances are common in chronic conditions like diabetes, with research showing that individuals with diabetes who reported short (15 h) or long (9 h) daily sleep were more likely to report serious psychological distress than individuals who slept 68 hours a day.27 Therefore, when exploring the relationship between sleep duration and anxiety, it is essential to account for the influence of demographic variables, lifestyle factors, and overall health status. Although prior studies have examined the association between sleep duration and anxiety, findings have been inconsistent. More importantly, few have systematically investigated how this relationship varies across sociodemo graphic subgroups using nationally representative data from the United States.

After applying these criteria, the final sample comprised 13,476 subjects (see Figure 1). Assessment of Anxiety Anxiety in the NHANES 20072012 study was assessed using a self-report question: During the past 30 days, for about how many days have you felt worried, tense, or anxious? Detailed information about this anxiety measure is available on the NHANES website (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2007-2008/HSQ_E.htm). Consistent with previous studies,2831 anxiety status was classified as no (felt anxious for 06 days per month) or yes (felt anxious for 730 days per month). Assessment of Sleep Duration Sleep duration in the NHANES 20072012 study was assessed through self-reporting. Participants were asked: How much sleep do you usually get at night on weekdays or workdays? Detailed information about this sleep measure is available on the NHANES website (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2007-2008/SLQ_E.htm). Based on their responses, sleep duration was classified into four categories: less than 5 hours (very short), 5 to less than 7 hours (short), 7 to less than 9 hours (normal), and 9 hours or more (long).32 Assessment of Covariates Covariate data were meticulously gathered, segmented by diverse demographic factors such as sex (female, male), age categories (2039, 4059, 60), race/ethnicity (Mexican American, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, other races), educational attainment (below high school, high school graduate, post-high school), marital status (married, separated/divorced/widowed, never married", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 10201, "end_char": 12418}, {"chunk_id": "wang2025association_chunk_007", "source_id": "wang2025association", "text": "), 5 to less than 7 hours (short), 7 to less than 9 hours (normal), and 9 hours or more (long).32 Assessment of Covariates Covariate data were meticulously gathered, segmented by diverse demographic factors such as sex (female, male), age categories (2039, 4059, 60), race/ethnicity (Mexican American, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, other races), educational attainment (below high school, high school graduate, post-high school), marital status (married, separated/divorced/widowed, never married), and poverty income ratio (PIR) classified into 130%, 130350%, and >350%. Participants smoking and drinking behaviors were categorized into never, former, and current based on their responses to self-administered questionnaires. Individuals who had never smoked 100 cigarettes were labeled as never smokers, those who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes and continued to smoke were designated as current smokers, while former smokers had a history of smoking 100 cigarettes but had since ceased.33 In terms of alcohol consumption, never drinkers had ingested fewer than 12 alcoholic beverages in their lifetime, former drinkers had consumed at least 12 drinks but abstained in the past year, and current drinkers had both consumed at least 12 drinks and had alcohol intake within the last year.34 Body mass index (BMI) was stratified into four distinct categories based on physical examination results: underweight (<18.5 kg/m), normal weight (18.524.9 kg/m), overweight (2529.9 kg/m), and obese (30 kg/m).35 Physical activity (PA) was assessed using the Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET), a standardized measure that evaluates energy expenditure relative to resting metabolic rate and functions as a key marker of exercise intensity.36 Data were gathered through the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ), with MET values assigned in accordance with NHANES guidelines. Vigorous activities, including both work-related and leisure- time activities, were assigned a MET value of 8.0. Moderate activities, such as work-related tasks, leisure-time activities, and transportation-related tasks like walking or cycling, were assigned a MET value of 4.0. Weekly MET minutes (MET- min/week) were computed by multiplying the MET value for each activity by its weekly frequency and session duration (in minutes), then summing these across all activity types.37,38 According to the", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 11896, "end_char": 14299}, {"chunk_id": "wang2025association_chunk_008", "source_id": "wang2025association", "text": " through the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ), with MET values assigned in accordance with NHANES guidelines.

Blood pressure readings were taken up to four consecutive times by trained professionals, with the average of a minimum of three measurements determining both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Hypertension was identified if participants met any of the following: a self-reported diagnosis by a healthcare provider, ongoing use of antihypertensive drugs, or an average SBP of 140 mmHg or higher, or an average DBP of 90 mmHg or Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2025:18 https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S516062 1157 Wang et al Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) higher during the examination.28,33 Diabetic status was established based on whether participants had been previously diagnosed, were currently using insulin, or were taking other diabetes-related medications.40 Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), with scores of 10 or above indicating the presence of depression.41 Participants were asked whether they had used any prescription medications in the past month and, if so, Figure 1 Flowchart of participants inclusion and exclusion.

This information was used to identify sedative-hypnotic medications, including chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, oxazepam, flurazepam, estazolam, alprazolam, clorazepate, lorazepam, diazepam, tema zepam, triazolam, zolpidem, eszopiclone, and zaleplon.42 Statistical Analysis Unweighted frequencies and weighted percentages were used to describe the categorical variables, ensuring population- representative characteristics. Weighted Chi-squared tests were performed to assess differences between anxiety groups. Weighted Robust Poisson regression was applied to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between sleep duration and anxiety. Given that over 25% of participants reported anxiety symptoms, logistic regression, which estimates odds ratios, may overstate relative risks, leading to potential misinterpretation. In contrast, robust Poisson regression directly estimates IRRs, offering a more accurate and interpretable measure, particularly when the event rate exceeds 15%, as in this study. By using a sandwich estimator, this method also addresses overdispersion in standard Poisson regression, ensuring stable and reliable estimates. Therefore, robust Poisson regression was preferred over logistic regression or standard Poisson regression due to its suitability for handling high event rates and providing more reliable estimates. Three models were constructed for the analysis: Model 1 with no adjustments; Model 2 adjusted for sex, age, race, education level, marital status, PIR, and BMI; and Model 3 adjusted for sex, age, race, education level, marital status, PIR, BMI, smoking status, drinking status, physical activity, hypertension, diabetes, depression and sedative-hypnotic drugs", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 15400, "end_char": 17795}, {"chunk_id": "wang2025association_chunk_010", "source_id": "wang2025association", "text": "dispersion in standard Poisson regression, ensuring stable and reliable estimates.

Additionally, several variables, including age, sex, race, education level, marital status, PIR, smoking status, drinking status, BMI, physical activity, depression, and the use of hypnotics, were all significantly associated with anxiety symptoms. Table 2 presents the association between sleep duration and anxiety, with IRRs and 95% CIs provided for short sleep durations (<5 hours and 57 hours) and long sleep durations (9 hours) compared to the mid-range category (79 hours). In the unadjusted model (Model 1), participants with less than 5 hours of sleep had a 138% higher risk of anxiety symptoms (IRR = 2.38, 95% CI [2.09, 2.70]), and those sleeping 57 hours had a 30% higher risk (IRR = 1.30, 95% CI [1.21, 1.40]). Long sleep durations (9 hours) were also associated with a 26% higher risk (IRR = 1.26, 95% CI [1.08, 1.48]).

Long sleep durations (9 hours) were also associated with a 26% higher risk (IRR = 1.26, 95% CI [1.08, 1.48]). After adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic factors (Model 2), the increased risk of anxiety symptoms remained significant for participants sleeping less than 5 hours (IRR = 2.16, 95% CI [1.91, 2.45]) and 57 hours (IRR = 1.28, 95% CI [1.19, 1.37]), while the risk for long sleep durations (9 hours) decreased slightly but remained statistically significant (IRR = 1.23, 95% CI [1.05, 1.43]). In the fully adjusted model (Model 3), which included additional lifestyle and health-related factors, the risk associated with less than 5 hours of sleep was reduced but remained significant at 40% (IRR = 1.40, 95% CI [1.23, 1.59]), while the risk for 57 hours of sleep persisted at 17% (IRR = 1.17, 95% CI [1.09, 1.25]).

Regarding race, racial minorities experienced stronger associations with very short (IRR = 1.39 [1.231.57]) and short sleep durations (IRR = 1.20 [1.081.34]) compared to Non-Hispanic White individuals (very short: IRR = 1.37 [1.171.60]; short: IRR = 1.14 [1.041.24]). Marital status further modulated the relationship between short sleep duration and anxiety, with married individuals showing higher anxiety risks associated with very short sleep durations (IRR = 1.47 [1.221.77]) than their non- married counterparts (IRR = 1.29 [1.101.51]). Notably, long sleep durations (9 hours) were generally not significantly associated with anxiety, except in younger adults and non-married individuals, where increased risks were observed.

Both very short sleep duration (<5 hours) and short sleep duration (5 to <7 hours) were independently associated with higher anxiety symptoms, even after adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors. Subgroup analyses revealed that males, older adults, racial minorities, and married individuals exhibited greater sensitivity to the adverse effects of short sleep duration on anxiety. Extended sleep duration (9 hours) was typically not associated with anxiety symptoms, but in certain subgroups, such as younger adults and non-married individuals, it was found to elevate the risk of anxiety. Our findings of a significant association between short sleep duration and anxiety align with previous research.1015,4345 Several mechanisms may underlie this observed relationship. The predominant theory suggests that inadequate sleep impairs brain regions responsible for emotional regulation,46 a dysfunction commonly observed in individuals with anxiety. Specifically, insufficient sleep increases the amygdalas reactivity to negative stimuli.47 Research has shown that decreased functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the amygdala occurs following total sleep deprivation, five nights of partial sleep restriction (four hours per", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 25678, "end_char": 28241}, {"chunk_id": "wang2025association_chunk_019", "source_id": "wang2025association", "text": "-married individuals, it was found to elevate the risk of anxiety. Our findings of a significant association between short sleep duration and anxiety align with previous research.1015,4345 Several mechanisms may underlie this observed relationship. The predominant theory suggests that inadequate sleep impairs brain regions responsible for emotional regulation,46 a dysfunction commonly observed in individuals with anxiety. Specifically, insufficient sleep increases the amygdalas reactivity to negative stimuli.47 Research has shown that decreased functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the amygdala occurs following total sleep deprivation, five nights of partial sleep restriction (four hours per night), or in individuals who habitually sleep less than 6.5 hours per night.4749 This suggests that the heightened reactivity of the amygdala may result from diminished regulatory control by the mPFC. Moreover, short sleep duration has been linked to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to increased cortisol secretion,50 which is strongly associated with anxiety disorders.51 Additionally, insufficient sleep has been connected to heightened systemic inflammation,52 a factor that may contribute to the development of anxiety.53 The combined effects of these physiological changes may help explain the increased risk of anxiety observed in individuals with shorter sleep durations. However, a previous Mendelian randomization study found no causal association between short sleep duration and anxiety,16 which contrasts with our findings. The observed discrepancy may arise from the fact that Mendelian randomization studies predominantly reflect limited population groups, which greatly limits the applicability of their findings to more diverse groups,17 such as the US population analyzed in this study. Future research should aim to include more diverse cohorts to more Table 3 Subgroup Analyses for the Effect of Sleep Duration on Anxiety Risk < 5 57 79  9 P for Interaction IRR (95% CI) P IRR (95% CI) P IRR (95% CI) P Sex 0.011 Female 1.24 (1.10, 1.41) 0.002 1.10 (1.01, 1.20) 0.029 Reference 1.05 (0.88, 1.24) 0.601 Male 1.59 (1.29, 1.95) <0.001 1.23 (1.08, 1.40) 0.004 Reference 1.23 (0.96, 1", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 27507, "end_char": 29781}, {"chunk_id": "wang2025association_chunk_020", "source_id": "wang2025association", "text": ") P IRR (95% CI) P IRR (95% CI) P Sex 0.011 Female 1.24 (1.10, 1.41) 0.002 1.10 (1.01, 1.20) 0.029 Reference 1.05 (0.88, 1.24) 0.601 Male 1.59 (1.29, 1.95) <0.001 1.23 (1.08, 1.40) 0.004 Reference 1.23 (0.96, 1.57) 0.118 Age (years) <0.001 < 60 1.38 (1.21, 1.56) <0.001 1.12 (1.04, 1.21) 0.005 Reference 1.19 (1.03, 1.39) 0.026  60 1.46 (1.15, 1.86) 0.004 1.35 (1.15, 1.58) 0.001 Reference 0.89 (0.67, 1.19) 0.453 Race 0.004 Non-Hispanic White 1.37 (1.17, 1.60) 0.001 1.14 (1.04, 1.24) 0.006 Reference 1.20 (1.00, 1.44) 0.056 Other 1.39 (1.23, 1.57) <0.001 1.20 (1.08, 1.34) 0.002 Reference 0.84 (0.69, 1.01) 0.071 Educational attainment 0.456 Above high school 1.47 (1.26, 1.72) <0.001 1.15 (1.05, 1.25) 0.005 Reference 1.12 (0.93, 1.35) 0.239 High School or Less 1.34 (1.15, 1.57) <0.001 1.18 (1.04, 1.34) 0.017 Reference 1.08 (0.88, 1.33) 0.476 Marital status 0.019 Married ", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 29571, "end_char": 30448}, {"chunk_id": "wang2025association_chunk_021", "source_id": "wang2025association", "text": ".456 Above high school 1.47 (1.26, 1.72) <0.001 1.15 (1.05, 1.25) 0.005 Reference 1.12 (0.93, 1.35) 0.239 High School or Less 1.34 (1.15, 1.57) <0.001 1.18 (1.04, 1.34) 0.017 Reference 1.08 (0.88, 1.33) 0.476 Marital status 0.019 Married 1.47 (1.22, 1.77) <0.001 1.18 (1.07, 1.30) 0.002 Reference 0.98 (0.81, 1.20) 0.855 Other 1.29 (1.10, 1.51) 0.004 1.13 (0.98, 1.30) 0.115 Reference 1.25 (1.03, 1.51) 0.031 PIR 0.133 > 350% 1.50 (1.15, 1.97) 0.006 1.25 (1.11, 1.41) <0.001 Reference 1.25 (0.91, 1.71) 0.183  350% 1.33 (1.20, 1.49) <0.001 1.10 (1.03, 1.19) 0.014 Reference 1.04 (0.91, 1.19) 0.604 Notes: The model was adjusted for sex, age, race, education level, marital status, PIR, BMI, smoking status, drinking status, physical activity, hypertension, diabetes, depression and sedative-hypnotic drugs.

Additionally, combining genetic approaches with observational studies could provide a more comprehensive understanding of this association. Our overall analysis did not find an association between long sleep duration and anxiety, which is consistent with some previous studies.12,16 However, other research has identified a significant link between the two.1820 Prather et al found that individuals with longer sleep durations had elevated levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein, suggesting that increased inflammatory cytokines may be a mechanism linking longer sleep with various health conditions.54 Although there is evidence indicating the impact of inflammation on anxiety,55 further research is needed to explore this relationship in greater detail. Our study adds to the existing evidence by highlighting variations in the association between sleep duration and anxiety across demographic subgroups. Notably, our findings show that males may be particularly sensitive to the effects of short sleep on anxiety. While short sleep impairs cognitive and executive functioning in both males and females, males achievement-oriented tendencies may amplify the psychological impacts of these impairments, potentially increasing their susceptibility to anxiety.56,57 Furthermore, insufficient sleep, particularly reduced slow-wave sleep, has been linked to lower testosterone levels,58,59 which are associated with heightened anxiety.60,61 Together, these findings suggest that males may experience heightened anxiety due to a combination of psychological and physiological vulnerabilities associated with short sleep. Additionally, our findings indicate that older adults (aged 60 and above) are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of short sleep on anxiety, likely due to age-related declines in sleep quality. With advancing age, individuals often experience more frequent sleep disruptions and reduced slow-wave sleep, both essential for restorative rest.62,63 Studies have also linked declines in rapid eye movement sleep to impaired regulation of negative emotions, a more pronounced relationship in", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 30895, "end_char": 33730}, {"chunk_id": "wang2025association_chunk_023", "source_id": "wang2025association", "text": " testosterone levels,58,59 which are associated with heightened anxiety.60,61 Together, these findings suggest that males may experience heightened anxiety due to a combination of psychological and physiological vulnerabilities associated with short sleep.

With advancing age, individuals often experience more frequent sleep disruptions and reduced slow-wave sleep, both essential for restorative rest.62,63 Studies have also linked declines in rapid eye movement sleep to impaired regulation of negative emotions, a more pronounced relationship in older adults.64,65 In addition to these physiological changes, older individuals may face shifts in social roles, reduced social support, and heightened feelings of loneliness, all of which are strongly associated with anxiety and other negative emotional states.66,67 These physiological and social factors together may exacerbate the detrimental effects of insufficient sleep, increasing anxiety vulnerability among older adults. By comparison, a significant association between long sleep duration and anxiety is observed primarily in younger individuals. In younger participants, long sleep is associated with elevated levels of inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein,54,68 which have been linked to increased anxiety risk.55 However, in older adults, who often have higher baseline levels of chronic inflammation,69 this pre-existing state may dampen their physiological sensitivity to additional inflammatory triggers, such as long sleep duration, making the impact less pronounced. It is worth noting that in the age subgroup analysis, 7 to 9 hours of sleep was uniformly defined as the reference range for all age groups (< 60 years and  60 years). While this aligns with general sleep guidelines, existing literature presents mixed conclusions about changes in sleep needs with age. Previous research suggest that older adults generally sleep less than younger individuals due to changes in sleep architecture.70 However, our data showed that older adults reported an average sleep duration of 6.94 hours (SD = 1.49), which was slightly longer than the 6.75 hours (SD = 1.40) observed among younger adults, a statistically significant difference (t = 7.11, df = 13,474, p < 0.001). These findings are consistent with some studies suggesting that older adults may require similar or even slightly more sleep than younger individuals,71,72 challenging the view that sleep needs decline with age.

Future studies should focus on developing age- specific sleep reference ranges to better capture older adults unique sleep characteristics and health outcomes. Our study also revealed significant racial disparities, with non-majority racial groups in the US showing a higher risk of anxiety linked to short sleep duration. Previous research has suggested that racial and ethnic minorities, as well as socio economically disadvantaged groups, are more likely to experience sleep patterns associated with adverse health outcomes.73 This elevated risk may be partly due to chronic stressors, such as cultural attitudes and discrimination, which minority groups are more likely to face. One study found that individuals from minority groups who experienced discrimination during the day were more likely to report sleep disturbances that night.74 Moreover, these individuals may encounter additional stressors, including low-income challenges, poor housing and community environments, and inadequate social support systems,7578 which may further amplify the relationship between short sleep duration and anxiety. Furthermore, a significant link between short sleep duration and anxiety was evident in both married and unmarried groups, with the connection notably stronger among married individuals. Married individuals, especially Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2025:18 https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S516062 1163 Wang et al Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) those with children, tend to shoulder greater family responsibilities and caregiving duties,79 and insufficient sleep can impair their ability to regulate negative emotions, leading to a notable increase in anxiety levels. Additionally, differences in sleep habits or schedules between partners can adversely affect sleep quality.80,81 Interestingly, unmarried individuals further exhibited the effects of long sleep duration on anxiety. A possible explanation is that unmarried individuals may experience a lack of social support and more irregular lifestyles.

However, this interpretation requires further exploration in future studies. This study benefits from the use of NHANES data, providing a large, nationally representative sample and ensuring robust results through adjustments for demographic, lifestyle, and health factors. The analysis of sex, age, race, and marital status subgroups offers new insights into how sleep duration affects anxiety across different demographics. However, this study also has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, its cross-sectional design precludes the ability to establish causal relationships between sleep duration and anxiety symptoms. Second, both sleep duration and anxiety were assessed using single self-reported items. While these methods are widely used in large-scale epidemiological surveys due to their feasibility and low respondent burden, they are inherently limited in their ability to capture important dimensions such as sleep quality, variability, and disturbances. In addition, self-reported measures are subject to individual misperceptions, particularly in estimating sleep duration. Furthermore, anxiety symptoms often co-occur with other mental health conditions, making it difficult to isolate their independent association with sleep patterns. Future research should incorporate more comprehensive and objective assessments, such as actigraphy or polysomnography, to improve the accuracy of sleep measurement and validate the current findings. It is also important to consider other potentially influential factors, such as disrupted sleep patterns, elevated stress levels, interference with social and occupational functioning, and underlying or ongoing health conditions, which may mediate or confound the observed associations. In addition, future studies could explore differences in sleep patterns between workdays and weekends, as such variations may offer further insight into the relationship between sleep duration and anxiety, and help inform more targeted intervention strategies. Conclusions Findings from this study suggest a potential association between short sleep duration and an increased risk of anxiety symptoms, particularly among males, older adults, racial minorities, and married individuals.

Methods: Baseline data from a lifestyle intervention trial with young adults (ages 1835 years) with SMI included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), mental health, physical health, and health behavior outcomes. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression were used in analyses. Results: Of 150 participants, 76% were categorized with poor sleep quality. Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with sleep quality ( = .438, p < .001); however, no association was found with physical health and health behaviors. Conclusions: Young adults with SMI enrolled in lifestyle interventions may benefit from treatment that addresses sleep as part of a comprehensive approach to health promotion with attention to the role of depressive symptoms in sleep quality.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Keywords Sleep; serious mental illness; depressive symptoms; lifestyle intervention; young adults INTRODUCTION Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI), including schizophrenia-spectrum and severe bipolar and depressive disorders, have a life expectancy that is 8 to 32 years less than people without mental illness (Colton & Manderscheid, 2006; Druss et al., 2011). This early mortality disparity is largely due to cardiovascular disease and other preventable chronic illnesses (Casey Crump et al., 2013; Olfson et al., 2015). Smoking cessation, physical activity and exercise, and dietary changes have been the primary targets of lifestyle interventions addressing cardiovascular health among individuals with SMI to date (Bartels et al., 2013; Bartels et al., 2015; Daumit et al., 2013; Green et al., 2015; Peckham et al., 2017). However, poor sleep is also a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature mortality (Cappuccio et al., 2010; Daghlas et al., 2019; Kwok et al., 2018), and sleep problems are common among adults with SMI across diagnostic groups (Freeman et al., 2020; Laskemoen et al., 2019) and negatively impact functioning and quality of life (Faulkner & Bee, 2016). Individuals with SMI place a high value on getting good quality sleep (Klingaman et al., 2019) and prefer non-pharmacological sleep", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 1794, "end_char": 3959}, {"chunk_id": "aschbrenner2022sleep_chunk_003", "source_id": "aschbrenner2022sleep", "text": " sleep is also a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature mortality (Cappuccio et al., 2010; Daghlas et al., 2019; Kwok et al., 2018), and sleep problems are common among adults with SMI across diagnostic groups (Freeman et al., 2020; Laskemoen et al., 2019) and negatively impact functioning and quality of life (Faulkner & Bee, 2016). Individuals with SMI place a high value on getting good quality sleep (Klingaman et al., 2019) and prefer non-pharmacological sleep treatment that is personalized and part of a whole-lifestyle approach (Faulkner & Bee, 2017). Lifestyle interventions have been shown to improve sleep among overweight and obese individuals in the general population (MacLeod et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2016), and may be an effective modality for treating interrelated health behaviors of diet, exercise, and sleep among adults with SMI. The present exploratory study characterized subjective sleep quality and examined its relationship with other health behaviors in a transdiagnostic sample of young adults with SMI enrolled in a lifestyle intervention trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS This secondary data analysis used baseline data of randomized participants in the Fit Forward trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02815813) designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer support and mobile health technology intervention to reduce cardiometabolic risk in young adults with SMI. A trial protocol is described elsewhere (Aschbrenner et al., 2018). Participants enrolled were 150 young adults (43% men) aged 18 to 35 years (M = 28.38, SD = 4.54) with a BMI 25 kg/m2 (M = 37.14, SD = 7.4) who had an SMI (i.e., 43% Psychotic Disorders; 37% Mood Disorders; 17% Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); and 3% Anxiety Disorders), and wanted to lose weight and improve fitness through supported behavioral changes. Fifty-four percent of the sample identified as White and 30% identified as Latino. Seventy-one percent were taking antipsychotic medications at the time they enrolled in the study.

The study was approved by local institutional review boards and participants gave written informed consent to participate. Assessments Baseline assessments documented demographic, sleep, mental health, physical health, and health behavior variables. Trained research interviewers administered research assessments to participants who were paid $50 USD for completing the interview. The dependent variable, sleep quality, was assessed using the self-report Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (Buysse et al., 1989), with 19 self-rated questions combined to form seven components scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance (e.g., bad dreams, pain, feeling too hot/too cold), use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction, each of which has a range of 03 points. A score of 0 indicates no difficulty, while a score of 3 indicates severe difficulty. The seven components are then added to yield one global score with a range of 021 points, with higher scores indicating worse sleep quality. A global score of  5 is associated with good sleep quality and a score of > 5 is associated with poor sleep quality. The global score was used as the continuous outcome variable in the multiple linear regression model. Independent variables included mental health, physical health, and health behavior variables. Mental health variables included self-reported depressive symptoms measured using the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale (Radloff, 1977), with a score range of 060 (higher scores reflect greater severity), and self-reported antipsychotic medication use (yes/no).

Physical health variables included objective measures of body mass index (BMI) calculated from measured height and weight (kg)/height(m)2, cardiorespiratory fitness assessed using the 6-Minute Walk Test (6-MWT) (Rasekaba et al., 2009), and obesity level (<40 BMI vs. 40 BMI). Health behavior variables included self-reported physical activity measured on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) with a summary score calculated for vigorous activities obtaining an estimate of weekly metabolic equivalent expenditure (MET) minutes of vigorous physical activity (Booth, 2000); sedentary behavior measured by the Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ) (Rosenberg et al., 2010), which assess the amount of time spent doing nine sedentary behaviors (e.g., watching television, playing computer/video games, driving riding in a car or bus). For each of the nine items, participants respond to the question, On a typical weekday (or weekend day), how much time do you spend (from when you wake up until you go to bed) doing the following? The available response options are none, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5hours, or 6 hours. Average sedentary hours across all days were calculated. Higher scores on the SBQ indicate more time performing sedentary behaviors; and finally, self-reported current smoking was assessed with a yes/no question and frequency and amount of alcohol use in the past 30 days assessed with questions adapted from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (Prevention, 2016). Data Analysis Descriptive statistics for PSQI subcomponent variables were calculated. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the relationship between the global PSQI sleep quality score and independent variables representing mental health (i.e., depressive symptoms and Aschbrenner et al.

Participants gender and age were included as covariates in each of the regression models. RESULTS As summarized in Table 1, 76% of participants were categorized with poor sleep quality, and 34% described their sleep quality as either fairly bad (22%) or very bad (12%). Fifty-three percent of participants indicated that they could not fall asleep within 30 minutes at least once per week, whereas 69% reported 7 or more hours of sleep per night, on average, over the past month. Forty-five percent of participants indicated they use medications to fall asleep three or more times per week. Multiple regression analysis was used to test if the mental health, physical health, and health behavior variables were significantly associated with the global PSQI sleep quality variable. The results of the regression indicated the independent variables explained 33% of the variance in sleep quality and the overall regression model was a good fit for the data (R2=.330, F (12,138)=5.16, p<.001). Self-reported depressive symptoms were significantly and positively associated with sleep quality.( = .438, p < .001), whereby greater depressive symptoms were associated with worse sleep quality.

DISCUSSION The purpose of this exploratory study was to characterize subjective sleep quality and examine its relationship with mental health and physical health and health behaviors in a transdiagnostic sample of young adults with SMI enrolled in a lifestyle intervention trial. We did not find significant associations between sleep quality and physical health and health behaviors at baseline in this sample; however, sleep quality was significantly associated with depressive symptoms consistent with prior research (Freeman et al., 2020). Findings from this brief report suggest that young adults with SMI enrolled in lifestyle interventions at community mental health centers may benefit from treatment that addresses sleep as part of a comprehensive approach to health promotion with specific attention to the role of depressive symptoms in sleep quality. Seventy-six percent of participants were categorized with poor sleep quality on the PSQI. In a large sample of college students aged 17 to 24, 60% of participants were categorized with poor sleep quality on the PSQI (Lund et al., 2010). Other studies with college students have classified 28%- 62% of participants as poor sleepers (Becker et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2020). The current sample included young adults aged 18 to 35 with SMI enrolled in a lifestyle intervention trial. The proportion categorized as having poor sleep quality was high. The point at which young adults with SMI express interest in health promotion and wellness programs may be an opportune time to engage them in a comprehensive approach to lifestyle change that includes sleep. Surprisingly, physical health and health behavior variables were not significantly associated with the PSQI global sleep quality score. Prior research has shown a bidirectional Aschbrenner et al.

Research using objective measures of sleep structure or quality may find relationships between sleep and physical health and health behaviors in this population. Discrepancies between subjective and objective measures of sleep have been shown in psychiatric populations (Krishnamurthy et al., 2018; Werner et al., 2016). While the primary interest of our study was patient reported outcome measures of sleep quality, future longitudinal research could include both subjective and objective measures of sleep to rigorously evaluate its relationship with changes in health behaviors and mental health and physical health outcomes. Limitations of the study also include the cross sectional design and select sample. The cross sectional design does not allow for determining the direction of the relationship between depression and sleep quality. While our sample of young adults with SMI who were motivated to enroll in a lifestyle intervention to lose weight and improve their fitness provides insight into sleep quality in this group, the sample also potentially limits generalizability of the findings to young adults with SMI in general. CONCLUSION Poor sleep quality is common among young adults with SMI who enrolled in a lifestyle intervention to lose weight and improve fitness. Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with poor sleep quality in this transdiagnostic sample of young adults with serious mental illness while physical health and health behaviors were not associated with sleep. Promoting good sleep as part of comprehensive lifestyle intervention for young adults with SMI and addressing the role of depressive symptoms in sleep quality should be considered in future research in this group.

Both sleep quantity and sleep quality are fundamental components of sleep. This review looks at both sleep quantity and sleep quality, considering how to manage the complex but probably unavoidable physiological phenomenon of sleep. The need for sleep has marked variations between individuals, in addition to the effects of variable conditions. Studies on sleep quality started later than those on sleep quantity, beginning in 1989 when Ford and Kamerow revealed that insomnia increases the risk of psychiatric disorders. According to the nationwide research team on the quality of sleep (19FA0901), sleep quality is superior to sleep quantity as an index for assessing sleep, and that restfulness obtained through sleep is a useful index for assessing sleep quality. We should pay more attention to obtaining sleep of good quality (restfulness, no sleepiness, no need for more sleep, sufcient objective sleep depth, etc.), although there have not been enough studies on the associations between sleep quality and health or disorders in children and adolescents. Further studies using the deviation from an individuals optimal sleep quantity may show us another aspect of the effects of sleep quantity on various life issues.

Introduction There is no doubt that sleep is one of the basic physiological processes for human survival [1]. However, with increasing economic and social demands, chronic sleep loss has been appreciated [2]. Under such circumstances, for most people in Japan, striving to achieve their best seems to become an important principle, even if this comes at the expense of sleep [3]. At least people in the modern society of Japan seem to be trying to reduce the duration of their sleep on the basis of the supercial idea that they can live effective lives without sleep, although much information on the importance of sleep has accumulated [1]. They want to spend the minimum effective time asleep, because recently people have thought of sleeping time as useless time. In fact, in Japan, sleep duration has decreased by 59 min during the last 50 years [4]. In the USA, the mean sleep duration decreased from 7.40 h in 1985 to 7.18 h in 2004. The percentage of adults in the USA sleeping for 6 h or less increased between 1985 (22.3%) and 2004 (28.6%) [5]. During 19052008, the sleep duration of children around the world aged 518 years decreased by approximately 0.75 min per night per year [4]. These declines were obvious in Asia (the mean change of minutes per year; 0.50), Canada (0.73), parts of Europe (0.92), and the USA (0.53), while sleep duration increased in Australia (+1.27), Scandinavia (+0.00) and the UK (+0.57) [6]. The sleep durations of preschoolers in Japan, especially nocturnal ones, reduced markedly over a period of nearly 70 years (between 19351936 and 2003) [7]. In both studies conducted in 19351936 and ", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 1674, "end_char": 3948}, {"chunk_id": "kohyama2021which_chunk_003", "source_id": "kohyama2021which", "text": " min per night per year [4].

The sleep durations of preschoolers in Japan, especially nocturnal ones, reduced markedly over a period of nearly 70 years (between 19351936 and 2003) [7]. In both studies conducted in 19351936 and 2003, bedtime, waking time, and nap duration were asked through a direct interview to each mother. In 19351936, the average sleep duration of infants aged 611 months was 13.0 h, with a nocturnal sleep duration of 11.3 h, while in 2003 the average was 11.7 h with a nocturnal sleep duration of 10.1 h. For Children 2021, 8, 542. https://doi.org/10.3390/children8070542 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/children Children 2021, 8, 542 2 of 13 3-year-old children, the average in 19351936 was 11.3 h with a nocturnal sleep duration of 11.0 h, and in 2003 the gures were 11.1 h and 9.7 h. The average sleep duration of 6-year-old children in 19351936 was 10.8 h, with the same nocturnal sleep duration, while in 2003 the gure was 10.2 h with a nocturnal sleep duration of 9.8 h. According to the Japan Society of School Health [8], the sleep duration of school pupils in Japan has recently been decreasing. From 1981 to 2016, sleep durations of grades 5 and 6 elementary school (ES) pupils decreased by 17 min in males and 24 min in females. Similarly, those of junior high school (JHS) pupils decreased 40 (male) and 38 (female) minutes.

In comparison with 1992, male and female senior high school (SHS) pupils slept 12 (male) and 6 (female) minutes less in 2016. It would not be a mistake to say that the sleep duration of children has recently decreased. Sharma and Kavuru [9] described modern society as a sleep-deprived society, stating that the average sleep duration in modern times is 6.8 h, as opposed to 9 h a century ago, although they gave no citation for this. In modern society, sleep is often not made a priority due to competing interests such as sports, media usage, and so on. Some people believe they can reduce their sleep duration if they can have high quality sleep. Regarding recent trends in US adult sleep duration, the mean sleep duration showed little change from 2004 to 2012, and the percentage of adults sleeping for 6 h or less (29.2%) also showed little change from 2004 to 2012 [5]. A systematic review [10] on adult sleep duration in 15 countries revealed that sleep duration from the 1960s until the 2000s increased in seven of the countries (Britain, Bulgaria, Canada, France, Korea, the Netherlands, and Poland (range: 0.11.7 min per night per year)), decreased in six of the countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, Japan, and Russia (range: 0.10.6 min per night per year)), and showed inconsistent results for Sweden and the USA. In spite of the aforementioned description of a sleep-deprived society [9], we are unable to conrm decreases in adult sleep duration since there is no data available from the early 1900s. However, it should also be noted that Matricciani et al. described that not adults sleep duration but adults sleep quality is declining recently [11]. The importance of sleep quality has gained recognition as an important sleep char- acteristic much later than studies conducted solely on sleep quantity.

However, it should also be noted that Matricciani et al. described that not adults sleep duration but adults sleep quality is declining recently [11]. The importance of sleep quality has gained recognition as an important sleep char- acteristic much later than studies conducted solely on sleep quantity. In 1964, Hammond reported that those who had a sleep duration of 7 h showed the lowest mortality during a 2-year follow up, with increasing death rates on both the shorter and the longer sides of this nadir [12]. Hammond also reported an association between insomnia and mortality in men [12]. Although no detail on the denition of insomnia was given in the report, non-restorative sleep or not feeling refreshed after sleeping was described as a symptom of insomnia in the 4th [13] and the 5th [14] editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, respectively. Thus, it may not be wrong to say that Hammonds insomnia could express a kind of sleep quality. After this study, however, many studies were conducted with a focus on the relationship between sleep duration and both mental and physical disorders, and Ford and Kamerow revealed in 1989 that insomnia increased the risk of psychiatric disorders [15]. At present, there is no denitive denition that can be used to assess sleep quality. In fact, a scale that is commonly used worldwide for assessing sleep quality (the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)) is known, but the questions in the PSQI are about usual sleep habits during the last month. According to Pilz et al. [16], the PSQI reveals sleep quality on workdays. The PSQI is presumed not to be a perfect scale for measuring sleep quality. Several recent studies [1729] have used a simple question to assess sleep quality, and the details of this are introduced in a subsequent section. This review looks at both sleep quantity and sleep quality, considering how to manage the complex but probably unavoidable physiological phenomenon of sleep.

Sleep Quantity Sleep quantity decreases from about 18 to 16 h per day in the newborn infant to 7 to 6 h in older individuals. These age-related changes are well-known [30,31]. Although no Children 2021, 8, 542 3 of 13 one knows why these alterations occur and what factors determine them, several gures for the optimal sleep quantity at different ages have been recommended [3234]. Age is not the only determinant of sleep quantity. Sleep quantity is also markedly different among countries. In 17 predominantly Asian and predominantly Caucasian countries/regions [35], sleep quantity was investigated through an Internet survey among children aged from birth to 36 months. This study revealed that total sleep quantity ranged from 11.6 h (Japan) to 13.3 h (New Zealand). The differences seen in sleep quantity may be contributed to cultural differences. Screen time [36] and extracurricular after-school activities [37] have been identied as factors that contribute to the decrease in sleep quantity. Delayed bedtime was found to decrease the sleep quantity of 3-year-old children [38], and a long waiting time for a late meal may lead to decreased night-time sleep duration in preschoolers [39]. Quante et al. [37] divided the factors that reduce sleep quantity into intrinsic factors and extrinsic ones. In addition to the aforementioned factors, the intrinsic ones include the reduction of the accumulation of sleep pressure building up during the day; early school schedules were one of the latter class of factors. Family lifestyle [40] must also be included among the extrinsic factors. Fukuda et al. [40] reported that childrens bedtime is also determined by delayed waking and meal times. According to a survey conducted during 20162018 in 28 public schools (15 ESs, 8 JHSs, and 5 SHSs) [41], the factors signicantly associated with a reduction in sleep quantity were longer after-school activity", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 8184, "end_char": 10656}, {"chunk_id": "kohyama2021which_chunk_007", "source_id": "kohyama2021which", "text": " In addition to the aforementioned factors, the intrinsic ones include the reduction of the accumulation of sleep pressure building up during the day; early school schedules were one of the latter class of factors.

According to a survey conducted during 20162018 in 28 public schools (15 ESs, 8 JHSs, and 5 SHSs) [41], the factors signicantly associated with a reduction in sleep quantity were longer after-school activity and more sleepiness (in all types of schools), higher grades and longer weekday screen times (in both ES and JHS), irregular dinners, skipping breakfast, longer weekend screen time and better self- reported academic performance (in ES), and higher standardized body mass index (BMI) (in SHS). These associations of short sleep duration with grade-related decline [30,31], screen time [36], after-school activity [37], breakfast skipping [42] and BMI [43] were consistent with previous studies. There are so many issues in modern society that are associated with a decrease in sleep quantity. 3. Insufcient Sleep Syndrome The problems produced by a loss of sleep quantity were well summarized by a 2011 editorial in Sleep Medicine entitled Give children and adolescents the gift of a good nights sleep: A call to action [44], which listed decreased cognitive functioning (e.g., inattention, decreased concentration), poor academic performance, decreased emotional regulation, increased behavior problems, psychopathology, the risk of accidental and automobile crash injuries, long-term deleterious effects on the cardiovascular, immune, various metabolic systems, and obesity. The International Classication of Sleep Disorders [45] describes the loss of sleep quantity in the second criterion (B) of the diagnostic criteria for insufcient sleep syndrome as the patients sleep time, established by personal or collateral history, sleep logs, or actigraphy, is usually shorter than expected for age. Loss of sleep quantity is the main issue used in the diagnosis of insufcient sleep syndrome. Among the problems associated with insufcient sleep syndrome, the same standard [45] describes irritability, concentra- tion and attention decits, reduced vigilance, distractibility, reduced motivation, anergia, dysphoria, fatigue, restlessness, lack of coordination, malaise, increased daytime sleepiness, concentration problems, lowered energy levels, depression, other", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 10057, "end_char": 12618}, {"chunk_id": "kohyama2021which_chunk_008", "source_id": "kohyama2021which", "text": " for insufcient sleep syndrome as the patients sleep time, established by personal or collateral history, sleep logs, or actigraphy, is usually shorter than expected for age. Loss of sleep quantity is the main issue used in the diagnosis of insufcient sleep syndrome. Among the problems associated with insufcient sleep syndrome, the same standard [45] describes irritability, concentra- tion and attention decits, reduced vigilance, distractibility, reduced motivation, anergia, dysphoria, fatigue, restlessness, lack of coordination, malaise, increased daytime sleepiness, concentration problems, lowered energy levels, depression, other psychological difculties, poor work performance, withdrawal from family and social activities, abuse of stimulants, and trafc accidents or injury at work, in addition to behavioral abnormalities in prepu- bertal children. According to these descriptions, it is assumed to be easy to diagnose an individual as having insufcient sleep syndrome. However, the standard textbook [45] also indicates that there is a poor correlation between subjectively reported sleepiness and multiple sleep latency test-measured sleepiness after sleep deprivation. The textbook mentions that individuals different susceptibility to sleep deprivation may produce this poor accordance. Children 2021, 8, 542 4 of 13 The amount of sleep needed varies from person to person and from night to night [46]. There are a number of factors that inuence sleep quantity including: genetic, behavioral, medical, and environmental factors [33]. It is widely recognized that loss of sleep quantity is associated with obesity, elevated blood pressure, and an elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases [44]; however, these results were obtained by comparisons among several sleep du- ration groups. It is not easy to determine the quantity of sleep that is not associated with the aforementioned health problems in each individual. Indeed, in several recommendations for optimal sleep quantity [3234], relatively wide ranges have been proposed. In a society that ignores sleep, there may be a person who pays attention to the lowest gure in these recommendations because he/she wants to minimize their sleep duration. Most people at least in Japan pay attention to the lowest gure in these recommendations because they want to minimize their sleep duration [3]. However, it should be claimed that there are people who need the highest gure for sleep quantity in these recommendations. It is not only most people but also many clinicians who have not noticed the problems derived from insufcient sleep, because most medical school programs do not have systematic courses on sleep, and", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 11979, "end_char": 14664}, {"chunk_id": "kohyama2021which_chunk_009", "source_id": "kohyama2021which", "text": "], relatively wide ranges have been proposed. In a society that ignores sleep, there may be a person who pays attention to the lowest gure in these recommendations because he/she wants to minimize their sleep duration. Most people at least in Japan pay attention to the lowest gure in these recommendations because they want to minimize their sleep duration [3]. However, it should be claimed that there are people who need the highest gure for sleep quantity in these recommendations. It is not only most people but also many clinicians who have not noticed the problems derived from insufcient sleep, because most medical school programs do not have systematic courses on sleep, and fail to show the importance of sleep for various aspects of health [47]. Common complaints by patients about daytime weakness, tiredness, concentration prob- lems, lowered energy levels, poor work performance, trafc accidents, injuries at work, and intellectual troubles may often be misunderstood as the consequences of life stresses such as family or social problems rather than of the more basic cause of sleep insufciency. It is obvious that medical professionals need to notice that some patients are suffering from sleep disruption including (social) jetlag or shift work. Of course, people should also be educated on the adverse effects of inadequate sleep for their health. Even in a small outpatient clinic for sleep, a considerable number of child patients with insufcient sleep syndrome have been found [48]. In the total of 181 child patients who visited a sleep clinic where the author was associated between August 2012 and March 2017, the most frequent nal diagnosis was insufcient sleep syndrome (n = 56). The most common complaint in the patients with this syndrome was difculty in waking in the morning (n = 35), followed by feeling sleepy all day (n = 12), falling asleep during a school class (n = 8), and feeling sick in the morning (n = 1). More effort is needed to recognize that the number of children who are suffering from insufcient sleep is not small. 4. Sleep Need Index (SNI) According to the International Classication of Sleep Disorders, Version 3 [45], the diagnostic criteria for insufcient sleep syndrome include sleep duration, and increased daytime sleepiness is said to appear as a result of this syndrome. The hypothesis is that the need for sleep can be expressed as a function of both sleep duration and sleepiness. Thus, the SNI was designed to use the following formula: sleepiness/sleep duration. The larger the value", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 13980, "end_char": 16526}, {"chunk_id": "kohyama2021which_chunk_010", "source_id": "kohyama2021which", "text": "n = 1).

The hypothesis is that the need for sleep can be expressed as a function of both sleep duration and sleepiness. Thus, the SNI was designed to use the following formula: sleepiness/sleep duration. The larger the value for this index, the larger the sleep need [49]. The SNI calculated in the previously cited survey revealed that SNI values ranged from 0.09 to 1.08, with a mean value of 0.26 and a standard deviation of 0.14. High sleep-need pupils were dened as those whose SNI was 0.26 or higher, while low sleep-need pupils were those whose SNI was less than 0.26. Higher grade, female gender, poor academic performance score, skipping breakfast, longer after-school activity, and higher physical activity were independently associated with high sleep-need pupils. To support adolescents with sleep need, the need for pupils to be instructed to take breakfast and to avoid excessive after-school and physical activities should be emphasized. 5. Future Assessment on Sleep Quantity Since sleep quantity can be measured objectively, albeit in various ways, it can be measured relatively easily. However, there are marked inter-individual differences in the need for sleep. Indeed, young adults with short sleep duration have been reported to be composed of several groups; those who are suffering from insomnia, those who complain of sleep shortage, and those who have no complaints [50]. Sleep quantity might be assessed Children 2021, 8, 542 5 of 13 not by actual duration, but by a deviation from the individuals own optimal sleep quantity. Therefore, before assessing the association between sleep quantity and other variables, the optimal sleep duration and deviation from an individuals own optimal sleep quantity should be measured in each person. Further studies using these variables may show us another aspect of the effects of sleep quantity on various life issues. Social jetlag [51] might be a potential indicator to compensate for the inter-individual differences of sleep need. 6. Sleepiness The standard textbook [45] often uses the term sleepiness when referring to in- sufcient sleep", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 15920, "end_char": 18412}, {"chunk_id": "kohyama2021which_chunk_011", "source_id": "kohyama2021which", "text": ", 542 5 of 13 not by actual duration, but by a deviation from the individuals own optimal sleep quantity. Therefore, before assessing the association between sleep quantity and other variables, the optimal sleep duration and deviation from an individuals own optimal sleep quantity should be measured in each person. Further studies using these variables may show us another aspect of the effects of sleep quantity on various life issues. Social jetlag [51] might be a potential indicator to compensate for the inter-individual differences of sleep need. 6. Sleepiness The standard textbook [45] often uses the term sleepiness when referring to in- sufcient sleep syndrome. Why does this subjective word appear so frequently? The assumption could be that objective information on sleep quantity is inadequate to de- ne insufcient sleep syndrome, because the amount of sleep needed has marked inter- individual variations in addition to the effects of variable conditions [45]. According to Komada et al. [51], a low sleep quantity as well as high levels of social jetlag were associ- ated with daytime sleepiness assessed by the Japanese version of the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale. Interestingly, marked attention has recently been paid to sleepiness in terms of aca- demic performance or self-regulation. Dewald et al. [52] examined the associations be- tween sleep quantity, sleep quality, sleepiness, and academic performance in three separate meta-analyses, including inuential factors (e.g., gender, age, parameter assessment) as moderators. Although all three sleep variables were signicantly but modestly related to school performance, sleepiness showed the strongest relationship to academic performance (r = 0.133), followed by sleep quality (r = 0.096) and sleep quantity (r = 0.069). Cohen-Zion and Shiloh [53] investigated the effects of sleep quantity, chronotype, and sleepiness on day-to-day executive abilities and academic performance in a healthy adolescent sam- ple. They found that the strongest predictors of impaired daily executive capacities were evening chronotype and degree of sleepiness, and they concluded that sleep quantity was a weak predictor of executive skills. In the survey among JHS and SHS pupils [54], pupils who recognized themselves as having poor academic performance showed more sleepiness than pupils who recognized themselves as having good (but not very good) academic performance. In all types of schools examined (ES, JHS, and SHS), sleep duration showed no signicant differences among the self-reported academic", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 17749, "end_char": 20317}, {"chunk_id": "kohyama2021which_chunk_012", "source_id": "kohyama2021which", "text": ", and sleepiness on day-to-day executive abilities and academic performance in a healthy adolescent sam- ple. They found that the strongest predictors of impaired daily executive capacities were evening chronotype and degree of sleepiness, and they concluded that sleep quantity was a weak predictor of executive skills. In the survey among JHS and SHS pupils [54], pupils who recognized themselves as having poor academic performance showed more sleepiness than pupils who recognized themselves as having good (but not very good) academic performance. In all types of schools examined (ES, JHS, and SHS), sleep duration showed no signicant differences among the self-reported academic performance categories. Short night-time sleep quantity is known to be a weaker predictor of poor self-regulation than daytime sleepiness among adolescents [55]. Self-regulation in adolescents contributes to a range of positive health and functioning outcomes that have potential long-term implica- tions. Moreover, in school children aged 1015, daytime sleepiness has been found to be associated with the frequency of neck, shoulder, and back pain [56]. Furthermore, Raine and Venables found that 15-year-old sleepy boys were more likely to be antisocial than non-sleepy boys [57]. From these results, they hypothesized that adolescent sleepiness predisposes an individual to later antisociality. Although they used a very brief and simple assessment of subjective daytime sleepiness, they succeeded in conrming that the well- known link between social adversity and adult crime is partly explained by sleepiness. Their results may have prognostic clinical/social value, and suggest that interventions to reduce sleepiness could be a useful way to prevent future crime. There are several standardized scales for assessing sleepiness. The Stanford Sleepiness Scale is based on the assumption that fatigue produces sleepiness [58], and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale evaluates the ease with which one falls asleep [59]. However, it should be noted that the testretest reliability of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale has recently been reported to be poor [60]. Through a single simple question, factors associated with sleepi- ness were assessed in a survey introduced above [41,54]. Sleepiness was categorized by the frequency with which pupils felt sleepy during class (never, sometimes, often, always). Sleepy pupils were dened as those who selected the choice of either often or always. By means of a stepwise procedure of multivariable logistic regression analysis, grade, bedtime before school days, non-school day screen time, academic performance, skipping Children ", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 19632, "end_char": 22284}, {"chunk_id": "kohyama2021which_chunk_013", "source_id": "kohyama2021which", "text": ", it should be noted that the testretest reliability of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale has recently been reported to be poor [60].

Taking these reports into consideration, it would be reasonable to assume that sleepi- ness is a better potential candidate than sleep quantity for assessing the executive function- ing of adolescents, even though it is subjective. We could pay more attention to sleepiness rather than sleep quantity when assessing the executive functioning of pupils. It should also be noted that sleepiness has been regarded as one of the issues that reect sleep quality [62]. 7. Sleep Quality Sleep quality is difcult to dene objectively. Even if the polysomnographic recording for a person shows a typical sleep progress chart of a night with a higher rate of deep sleep in the rst third of the night, increasing REM sleep and N2 sleep stage duration in the last third of a night, and a low incidence of intermittent waking, the quality of the sleep of the night is dened as poor if the individual was unsatised with the nights sleep [63]. For this reason, we have to dene the quality of sleep subjectively. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan organized a nationwide research team on the quality of sleep (19FA0901). The author was one of the review board members of the team. The team discussed sleepiness during the day, restlessness, and restfulness as candidates for assessing sleep quality. In 2021, the team reached ve conclusions: 1. Sleep quality is a superior sleep index to sleep quantity for assessing sleep; 2. Restfulness obtained through sleep is a useful index for assessing sleep quality; 3. Although PSQI and restfulness are correlated, these two indices are not identical;", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 21642, "end_char": 24136}, {"chunk_id": "kohyama2021which_chunk_014", "source_id": "kohyama2021which", "text": "ively.

Although PSQI and restfulness are correlated, these two indices are not identical; 4. PSQI includes sleep quantity and insomnia, while restfulness is complementary to either sleep duration, time in bed, or both; and 5. To obtain adequate sleep, people aged 64 or less need a longer sleep duration, whereas those aged 65 or more need a shorter time in bed. By means of a choice-based conjoint analysis, Ramlee et al. concluded that the top three parameters that determine sleep quality among 17 parameters were total sleep quantity, refreshed feeling upon waking, and the daytime mind state after sleep [64]. Although the study was carried out among older men, Faerman et al. [17] assessed the correlations between subjective sleep quality, determined by 5-point scales for sleep depth and restfulness in the morning, and actigraphic data, as well as heart rate, heart rate variability, and demographic and psychological variables. They found no correlation between the subjective and the objective measures. This result is consistent with a previous study by Kaplan and colleagues [18]. In 3173 men and women aged between 39 and 90, Kaplan et al. assessed the relationship between a morning rating of the prior nights sleep (sleep depth and restfulness) and polysomnographic and quantitative electroen- cephalographic descriptors of that single night of sleep. They concluded that objective data contribute little to explaining subjective sleep quality. They also assessed a single night of at-home polysomnographic recording of sleep followed by a set of morning questions concerning the prior nights sleep quality in older men (n = 1024) and women (n = 459) [19]. They found that the commonly obtained polysomnographic measures contributed little to the subjective ratings of the prior nights sleep quality. Clark et al.

[20] reported that the onset of sleep disturbance predicts a subsequent risk of hypertension and dyslipidemia. The onset of impaired sleep in this study included subjective issues such as difculty in falling asleep, difculty in maintaining sleep, early morning awakening, and non-restorative sleep. Bin [65] wrote a commentary on this article and summarized the main ndings of this report into two statements: 1. Sleep disturbance predicts the occurrence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, and 2. Sleep quality appears a more important risk factor than sleep duration for these disorders. Falbe et al. assessed restfulness by asking the question On how many days in the past week have you felt like you needed more sleep? of 2048 children in grades 4 and 7 [21]. They dened restfulness as having the feeling that more sleep was needed on Children 2021, 8, 542 7 of 13 three days or fewer, based on the notion that perceived restfulness may reect good sleep quality. Sleeping near a small screen, but not a TV, was associated with a signicantly higher prevalence of perceived insufcient restfulness, after adjustment for sleep quantity. This did not vary signicantly by grade, gender, physical activity, or race. As regards the reason why TV presence was not related to less restfulness, they speculated that TV sets do not interrupt sleep when turned off. They also demonstrated the association between a longer screen time and less restfulness. Using feeling fresh after waking-up as a representative issue to assess sleep quality of children, the following factors were shown to affect child sleep quality: gene, par- ent/caregiver, sleep disorders/medical problem, sleep habits/environment/medications, and screen exposure [66]. So far, as mentioned above, sleep depth, restfulness, non-restorative sleep on the prior night, sleepiness, and having the feeling that one needed more sleep on three or fewer days in the past week have been used as subjective measures of", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 25383, "end_char": 27846}, {"chunk_id": "kohyama2021which_chunk_016", "source_id": "kohyama2021which", "text": " sleep when turned off.

So far, as mentioned above, sleep depth, restfulness, non-restorative sleep on the prior night, sleepiness, and having the feeling that one needed more sleep on three or fewer days in the past week have been used as subjective measures of sleep quality. Among these, in- formation on restfulness from sleep is routinely obtained using the standard questionnaire in Specic Health Checkups, which is the annual health screening and promotion service organized by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare [22]. Kaneko et al. [23] investigated the association between restfulness from sleep and subsequent risk of car- diovascular disease using the medical records (obtained from the Japan Medical Data Center) of 1,980,476 individuals (mean age of 45  11 years, male vs. female ratio of 1.49, and mean follow-up period of 1122  827 days) without either prior cardiovascular disease or prior sleep disorders. Among the general population without a prior history of relevant cardiovascular disease, it was found that the incidence of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, stroke, heart failure, and atrial brillation was signicantly lower in those with good restfulness from sleep. However, this study did not assess the association of cardiovascular disease with sleep quantity. 8. Sleep Quantity and Quality in Patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Attention Decit/Hyperactivity Disorder Lugo et al. [67] conducted a meta-analysis including 42 studies, and found that both adult autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention decit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients showed higher sleep onset latency, poorer sleep efciency, greater number of awakenings during sleep, and a general lower self-perceived sleep quality compared with healthy controls. Another meta-analysis in children and adults with ADHD, reported that short sleep duration was signicantly associated with ADHD symptomatology, especially hyperactivity [68]. In ASD and ADHD children, more sleep problems and shorter sleep duration than controls were reported [69]. The same study also found that sleep problems are related to inadequate sleep hygiene in ASD and to evening", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 27208, "end_char": 29763}, {"chunk_id": "kohyama2021which_chunk_017", "source_id": "kohyama2021which", "text": " found that both adult autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention decit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients showed higher sleep onset latency, poorer sleep efciency, greater number of awakenings during sleep, and a general lower self-perceived sleep quality compared with healthy controls.

In ASD and ADHD children, more sleep problems and shorter sleep duration than controls were reported [69]. The same study also found that sleep problems are related to inadequate sleep hygiene in ASD and to evening chronotype in ADHD. Sleep studies on ASD and ADHD should also be encouraged. 9. Quantity Versus Quality Seow et al. [70] studied the association of both sleep quantity and sleep quality with physical and mental disorders in Singaporean adults. Although this study used PSQI as an index to assess sleep quality, it showed that both short sleep duration and poor sleep quality were associated with chronic pain, obsessive compulsive disorders, and mental disorders. In addition, poor sleep quality was found to be associated with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and physical disorder. After these analyses, the authors concluded that sleep quality is a more important indicator for psychological and overall health than sleep quantity. Lao et al. [24] examined associations between sleep measures and the development of coronary heart disease among 2740 adults aged 40 years or above who participated in a Taiwanese cohort. These authors assessed both sleep quantity and sleep quality. Sleep quality was assessed using a 5-point scale. The question was How do you evaluate your sleep situation last month?, and the ve possible selections were as follows: use of sleeping pills or drugs, difcult to fall asleep, dreamy sleep, can fall asleep but easily Children 2021, 8, 542 8 of 13 awaken, and sleep well. Since the number of participants who selected the rst option was small, this option was combined with the second one. Thus, sleep quality was assessed on a 4-point scale. For sleep quantity, the participants were asked How many hours do you usually sleep a day? with the following four options: less than 4 h, 46 h, 68 h, and 8 h or more. The study also assessed the sleep score, reecting both sleep quantity and sleep quality, against the development of coronary heart disease. Short sleep duration and poor sleep quality were found to be", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 29079, "end_char": 31650}, {"chunk_id": "kohyama2021which_chunk_018", "source_id": "kohyama2021which", "text": " 8 of 13 awaken, and sleep well.

The study also assessed the sleep score, reecting both sleep quantity and sleep quality, against the development of coronary heart disease. Short sleep duration and poor sleep quality were found to be associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Participants who had lower sleep scores also showed a higher risk of the disease. The authors concluded that both sleep quantity and sleep quality should be considered for developing strategies for improving sleep, with the aim of preventing coronary heart disease. Moore et al. found that the effects on health of sleep quality, assessed by 5-point scale (1 = poor and 5 = excellent; mean value of 3.1 with a standard deviation of 1.2), were greater than the effects of sleep quantity, even after adjusting for other individual characteristics [25]. They also showed that the impact of sleep quality on physical health increased as the subjects slept for shorter durations. Yang et al. [26] investigated the association between sleep measures (quantity and quality) and BMI among 10,007 adults living in the Philadelphia area. Sleep quality was assessed by asking about the participants sleep quality on a 5-point scale, with 1 being restless and 5 being restful. The question on sleep duration was How many hours of sleep do you get at night?. The overall sleep quality score was 3.61, with a standard deviation of 1.29. On average, men reported better sleep quality than women. Fifty-ve per cent of the women and 53% of the men slept for at least 7 h every night; 27% slept for between 6 and 7 h, and 20% slept for less than 5 h. The study found that better sleep quality was related to lower BMI in women, while men who slept for less than 5 h had a higher BMI than those who slept for 7 h or more. In order to reduce BMI, it may be useful to help men to increase their sleep duration and women to improve their sleep quality.

In order to reduce BMI, it may be useful to help men to increase their sleep duration and women to improve their sleep quality. These authors also examined the effect of both sleep quantity and sleep quality in mediating the relationship between perceived discrimination and health, and found that sleep quality rather than sleep duration mediates the unfavorable effect [27]. A meta-analytic study demonstrated that both short and long sleep duration, and dif- culty in maintaining sleep, were associated with a greater risk of type 2 diabetes [71]. From these results, Cappuccio et al. concluded that quantity and quality of sleep consistently and signicantly predicted the risk of the development of type 2 diabetes. The risk varies between 28% in people who report habitual sleep of 56 h per night and 84% in those with difculties in maintaining their sleep. In patients with chronic kidney disease, Ricardo et al. reported that ESS, but not PSQI, was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality [72]. In addition, they found signicant associations between greater sleep fragmentation and an increased risk of end-stage renal disease, and between both greater sleep fragmentation and shorter sleep duration and both a greater decline in estimated glomerular ltration rate and increased protein excretion. From these results, they concluded that short sleep, as well as poor sleep quality, are risk factors for the progression of chronic kidney disease. Taking these reports into consideration, we should emphasize that more attention should be paid to obtaining good quality sleep (restfulness, no sleepiness, no need for more sleep, sufcient objective sleep depth, etc.) in terms of avoiding sleep-related health problems. 10. Sleep Quality in Children and Adolescents So far, studies on sleep quality in children have been limited. As cited before, Falbe et al. [21] demonstrated that sleeping near a small screen was associated with a signicantly poor sleep quality in children of grades 4 and 7. Bruni et al. [28] assessed the sleep quality of pupils aged 1116 years by asking", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 32905, "end_char": 35312}, {"chunk_id": "kohyama2021which_chunk_020", "source_id": "kohyama2021which", "text": " should emphasize that more attention should be paid to obtaining good quality sleep (restfulness, no sleepiness, no need for more sleep, sufcient objective sleep depth, etc.) in terms of avoiding sleep-related health problems. 10.

[21] demonstrated that sleeping near a small screen was associated with a signicantly poor sleep quality in children of grades 4 and 7. Bruni et al. [28] assessed the sleep quality of pupils aged 1116 years by asking 15 questions on irregular sleep habits, prolonged sleep latency, and difculties in waking up in the morning. Each question was Children 2021, 8, 542 9 of 13 answered on a 5-point scale. The authors found that evening circadian preference, mobile phone and Internet use, number of other activities (music, television, gaming console, sport, etc.) after 21:00, late turning off time, and number of devices in the bedroom had an unfavorable effect on sleep quality. In addition to poor sleep quality related to these electric devices, Phillips et al. empha- sized the presumable inuence of sleep quality on health [73]. Indeed, Blackwell et al. [74] reported an association of good sleep quality with better general health. Javaheri et al. [75] investigated the association between sleep variables (sleep quantity and sleep quality) and blood pressure in 238 adolescents aged 1316 years who had no sleep apnea or severe co-morbidities. Actigraphic data was used, and a short sleep duration (6.5 h or less) and low sleep efciency (85% or less) were used for the sleep variables. These authors found that the odds for prehypertension, which was dened as either systolic, diastolic, or both, blood pressure being at or above 90% of the age, gender, and height standardized value, was increased 4.5-fold among participants with low sleep efciency, and 2.8-fold in those with short sleep duration. In addition, the participants with poor sleep quality (low sleep efciency) were found to have a systolic blood pressure 4.0 mmHg higher than the other adolescents. Martikainen et al. [76] examined the relationships between both sleep quantity and sleep quality", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 34728, "end_char": 36963}, {"chunk_id": "kohyama2021which_chunk_021", "source_id": "kohyama2021which", "text": " for prehypertension, which was dened as either systolic, diastolic, or both, blood pressure being at or above 90% of the age, gender, and height standardized value, was increased 4.5-fold among participants with low sleep efciency, and 2.8-fold in those with short sleep duration. In addition, the participants with poor sleep quality (low sleep efciency) were found to have a systolic blood pressure 4.0 mmHg higher than the other adolescents. Martikainen et al. [76] examined the relationships between both sleep quantity and sleep quality and cardiovascular function in children with a mean age of 8.0 years who had no sleep-disordered breathing. Sleep data were obtained through Actiwatch, and sleep latency, sleep fragmentation, and sleep efciency were used as variables reecting sleep quality. These authors found that neither sleep quantity nor sleep quality showed signicant associations with 24-h ambulatory blood pressure or cardiovascular reactivity. Berentzen et al. [29] found that girls aged 1112 years showed cardiovascular risk related to both sleep quantity and sleep quality, but they failed to obtain signicant results for boys. They used a questionnaire to obtain sleep characteristics such as time in bed, bedtime, getting-up time, night-time awakenings, and daytime outcomes. The latter two issues were taken to reect sleep quality. There were three questions on daytime outcomes. The rst one was about difculty with getting up in the morning and the second was about feeling rested after waking on a school day. On these questions, the answers were selected from two categories (yes or no). The third question was about the frequency of feeling sleepy or tired during the day, and the answers were divided into two categories, never or sometimes and at least once a week. Girls who spent a long time in bed (1112.5 h) had a signicantly lower body mass index and a smaller waist circumference compared with girls who spent 1010.5 h in bed. Girls who went to bed late and rose early had signicantly higher total cholesterol and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol than early to bed/early to rise girls. Girls who woke during the night almost every night, sometimes in combination with falling asleep again after a while or after a very long time, had higher total cholesterol than girls who did not wake during the night. Girls who felt sleepy/tired on one or more days per week had sign", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 36421, "end_char": 38838}, {"chunk_id": "kohyama2021which_chunk_022", "source_id": "kohyama2021which", "text": " time in bed (1112.5 h) had a signicantly lower body mass index and a smaller waist circumference compared with girls who spent 1010.5 h in bed.

Girls who felt sleepy/tired on one or more days per week had signicantly lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and higher total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio than girls who did not feel sleepy. According to Komada et al. [77], a COVID-19-related school closure decreased sleepi- ness in children and was associated with decreasing social jetlag, although with a delay in bedtime. In general, late bedtime is considered to be an unfavorable habit [44]. The overall effects of these alterations have remained to be claried. Summarizing the associations between sleep quality and health or disorders in chil- dren and adolescents, a lot of issues were found to be remained to be investigated. In particular, no denite criteria for assessing sleep quality have been established. Of course, it may be difcult to take only one aspect of sleep quality from a standardized set of criteria, because sleep has many biological, psychological, and other unknown aspects. Further broad studies are necessary to discover the details of sleep quality, especially among children. Children 2021, 8, 542 10 of 13 11. Another Sleep Issues to Be Investigated This review lacked discussions on timing of sleep. Disturbance of sleep phase has been known to be associated with chronotype [78]. Chronotype is reported to be associated with sleepiness [79], sleep-onset duration and sleep efciency during the rst two years of life [80], and metabolic dysfunction [81,82]. Timing of sleep and chronotype are also important issues to be investigated in terms of both private and public health. 12. Conclusions Both sleep quantity and sleep quality are fundamental components of sleep. Since there are marked inter-individual differences in the need for sleep, sleep quantity might be assessed not by actual duration but by a deviation from the individuals own optimal sleep quantity. For sleep quality, no standardized scale has been established, probably because sleep quality has many aspects.

At present, many studies have decided that sleep quality, rather than sleep quantity, is favorable for reecting health or functioning issues. However, these studies used actual values for sleep quantity. Further studies using the deviation from an individuals own optimal sleep quantity may show us another aspect of the effects of sleep quantity on various life issues.

Abstract Most people will at some point experience not getting enough sleep over a period of days, weeks, or months. However, the effects of this kind of everyday sleep restriction on high-level cognitive abilitiessuch as the ability to store and recall information in memory, solve problems, and communicateremain poorly understood. In a global sample of over 10 000 people, we demonstrated that cognitive performance, measured using a set of 12 well-established tests, is impaired in people who reported typically sleeping less, or more, than 78 hours per nightwhich was roughly half the sample. Crucially, performance was not impaired evenly across all cognitive domains. Typical sleep duration had no bearing on short-term memory performance, unlike reasoning and verbal skills, which were impaired by too little, or too much, sleep. In terms of overall cognition, a self-reported typical sleep duration of 4 hours per night was equivalent to aging 8 years. Also, sleeping more than usual the night before testing (closer to the optimal amount) was associated with better performance, suggesting that a single nights sleep can benefit cognition. The relationship between sleep and cognition was invariant with respect to age, suggesting that the optimal amount of sleep is similar for all adult age groups, and that sleep- related impairments in cognition affect all ages equally.

Key Words: cognitive function; short-term memory; executive function; sleep duration; effects of sleep restriction on cognition Statement of Significance We assessed over 10 000 participants on a comprehensive battery of cognitive tests to ask whether daily sleep dura- tion is associated with high-level cognition. Overall, cognitive performance was worse for participants who reported typically sleeping less or more than 78 hours per nightwhich was roughly half the sample. Importantly, not all high-level cognitive domains exhibited this relationship; sleep duration had no bearing on short-term memory, unlike high-level reasoning and verbal skills, which were impaired by too little, or too much, sleep. This relationship between sleep and cognition did not depend on age. Broadly, these results suggest that many people, who do not get enough sleep daily, may be operating with impaired reasoning and communication skills.

Regular and sufficient sleep helps maintain numerous aspects of physical and mental health [1, 2], but countless ordinary life circumstances, such as parenthood, demanding professions, studying, illness, or life- style choices often prevent people from getting a full nights sleep. In fact, in a recent US health survey [3] of approximately 250 000 people, 29.2% of respondents reported getting less than an average of 6 hours of sleep per night. Individuals who sleep this little on a day-to-day basis are considered to be experienc- ing chronic partial sleep deprivation (SD) (also known as sleep restriction), which, in a laboratory setting, has been associated with impaired physiological and cognitive functioning [4, 5]. Given the fact that so many people report sleeping so little, it seems likely that, as a population, our ability to function in the everyday world is being measurably affected. Indeed, it has been estimated that the productivity lost annually due to chronic par- tial SD costs an estimated $21.4 billion in Canada alone [6]. Solving everyday problems requires the cooperation of many different cognitive systems, from low-level functions like main- taining vigilance and attending to certain stimuli while ignoring distractions, to higher-level functions like encoding information into memory, manipulating that information, and communicat- ing the results to other people. It is well understood that many aspects of cognition, including higher-level functions like deci- sion making, are severely impaired by acute total sleep SD [7, 8]. However, the effects of naturalistic and chronic sleep restric- tion are less clear [5, 9], in part because fewer studies have been conducted about its effects on cognition than those involving total SD. In addition, those studies that do exist typically meas- ure the effects of partial SD over a short period of time in the lab, use tasks that measure low-level cognitive performance (e.g. vigilance), and when included in meta-analyses are lumped into one or two broadly-defined categories of cognitive functioning [4, 5, 9, 10]. As a result, while it appears that sleep restriction does impair cognition, it is not clear what cognitive domains are most affected (e.g. memory vs. problem-solving), and whether these impairments manifest from the type of chronic sleep restriction that many people are experiencing in everyday life.

As a result, while it appears that sleep restriction does impair cognition, it is not clear what cognitive domains are most affected (e.g. memory vs. problem-solving), and whether these impairments manifest from the type of chronic sleep restriction that many people are experiencing in everyday life. Previous cross-sectional studies of large survey-type data- sets have shown that some simple measures of cognition, like performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination, are related to sleep duration [1115]: people who report having an abnormal amount of sleep (e.g. too little or too much sleep) consistently performed worse on such tests. However, with one exception [15] these reports focused on global measures of cognitive per- formance [1214], and/or specific tests sensitive to the onset of Alzheimers disease [11, 13], giving a narrow view of cognitive performance. Also, despite their large samples, none of these studies looked at whether the relationship between sleep dura- tion and cognition depended on demographic variables, like age. After all, it is commonly observed that nightly sleep decreases as we get older [16], and mounting evidence suggests that sleep is important for preserving cognitive function in older adults [17]. Current recommendations [18] suggest that people 65 years and older may need slightly less sleep than younger adults, but these guidelines are based on many factors other than just cognition. In the current study, we leveraged the power of the Internet to investigate the relationship between everyday sleep and cog- nition in more than 10 000 individuals drawn from all walks of life, age groups, and backgrounds. Volunteers completed the Cambridge Brain Sciences (CBS) online 12-test battery, which taps a broad range of cognitive abilities, such as aspects of inhibition, selective attention, reasoning, verbal short-term memory, spatial working memory, planning, visuospatial work- ing memory, and cognitive flexibility. The tests have been vali- dated in patients with anatomically-specific brain lesions [19, 20], in neurodegenerative populations [21, 22], in pharmaco- logical intervention studies [23, 24], and their neural correlates have been thoroughly described using functional neuroimaging [2528", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 5665, "end_char": 8219}, {"chunk_id": "wild2018dissociable_chunk_005", "source_id": "wild2018dissociable", "text": ", age groups, and backgrounds.

By combining participants scores from the broad range of cognitive tests with self-reported information about how much they slept in the past month and on the night before testing, we investigated how real-life sleeping patterns are related to cognition. Specifically, we asked whether the typical amount of sleep was associated with cognitive performance globally, or in specific domains. Then, we looked at whether deviation from the usual amount of sleep had any bearing on cognition. Given the large and diverse sample, we were also able to ask whether the amount of sleep required for normal cognition depended on age. We hypothesized that those participants who typically slept less than (or significantly more than) some optimal amount would exhibit poorer cognition across all domains, yielding an inverted-U shaped association between cognition and sleep duration. Finally, we predicted that this effect would be modu- lated by age, such that getting too little or too much sleep would be associated with disproportionately worse performance for older, compared to younger, adults. Materials and Methods Participants and data selection All data for this study were collected with the CBS (www. cambridgebrainsciences.com) online platform, which has previ- ously been used for other large-scale studies of cognition [29]. Visitors to the website could learn about and volunteer to partic- ipate in this study, which was approved by Western Universitys Health Sciences Research Ethics Board. Recruitment was accom- plished through social media advertisements (Facebook and Twitter) and word of mouth, and volunteers received no com- pensation for participating in the study. Participants acknowl- edged that they could speak fluent English to read the study letter of information, letter of consent, and instructions.

See Supplementary Table S1 for a summary of these characteristics in the final sample. Completing the registration process, questionnaire, and 12 tests took approximately 60 minutes. Overall, 40 105 people registered to participate in this study. Of those, 16 812 people completed the questionnaire and all 12 tests. Most of this attrition (N = 23 293) was due to techni- cal issues related to server performance during the initial surge of registrations that prevented participants from completing stages of the experiment. Participants were excluded from the analysis if they: reported their age to be less than 18 or more 2 | SLEEPJ, 2018, Vol. 41, No. 12 Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/41/12/zsy182/5096067 by guest on 01 February 2026 than 100 years (N = 1175); reported sleeping zero or more than 16 hours per night (N = 514); or had missing data for any question- naire items or test scores (N = 3853).

Cognitive test battery After the questionnaire, participants completed the 12 tests in the CBS test battery. Test order was randomized across partici- pants. Detailed descriptions of the tests (including screen shots and test-retest reliability) can found in the Supplementary Material, but in brief they are: (1) Spatial Span (short-term mem- ory); (2) Monkey Ladder (visuospatial working memory); (3) Paired Associates; (4) Token Search (working memory and strategy); (5) Odd One Out (deductive reasoning); (6) Rotations (mental rota- tion); (7) Feature Match (feature-based attention and concentra- tion); (8) Spatial Planning (planning and executive function); (9) Interlocking Polygons (visuospatial processing); (10) Grammatical Reasoning (verbal reasoning); (11) Double Trouble (a modified Stroop task); and (12) Digit Span (verbal working memory). Cognitive performance scores Our measures of cognitive performance comprised scores from the 12 individual tests, and four composite scores reflecting performance overall and in three specific domainsshort-term memory (STM), reasoning, and verbal ability. These three cog- nitive domains have been found to explain a large proportion of the variability in performance across the test battery and are associated with distinct functional brain networks [29]. To calculate these composite scores, the 12 individual test scores were first normalized (M = 0.0, SD = 1.0). The three cognitive domain scores were calculated using the formula, Y X Ar T = ( ) + , where Y is the N  3 matrix of domain scores, X is the N  12 matrix of test z-s", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 11415, "end_char": 13616}, {"chunk_id": "wild2018dissociable_chunk_008", "source_id": "wild2018dissociable", "text": " and in three specific domainsshort-term memory (STM), reasoning, and verbal ability.

The overall measure of performance was calculated as the average of 12 test z-scores scaled to have a mean of 0.0 and SD of 1.0 in this pop- ulation; for each individual, the overall score represents their average performance across the entire test battery. Data analysis Data were analyzed in Python (version 3.6.2, www.python.org.

Linear regression models were constructed to predict each of the 16 scores from participants reported sleep duration and associated questionnaire data, and were estimated using ordi- nary least squares. The relationship between cognitive perfor- mance and the typical sleep duration (i.e. the self-reported average number of hours slept per night in the past month) was modeled as a second-order (i.e. quadratic) polynomial, by including two regressors: the reported number of hours slept per night, and the square of this value. Continuous variablesage and sleep duration (before polynomial expansion)were mean centered before being added as regressors in the model. The covariates of no interestgender, level of education, frequency of anxiety, and frequency of depressionwere all included as N  1 dummy coded (0 or 1) regressors, where N is the number of categories for each variable (e.g. three levels of genderFemale/ Male/ Otherwere modeled with two dummy variables). The interaction between typical sleep duration and age was included by specifying two additional regressors (i.e. age times each of the two sleep duration variables). With an included intercept term, the design matrix for each scores regression model had 20 columns and 10 886 rows. To investigate the effect of a single nights sleep on cogni- tionspecifically, whether deviating from the usual amount of sleep was associated with performancewe introduced another factor into our regression analyses: the sleep delta. This term was calculated as the difference between the estimated num- ber of hours slept the night prior to testing, and the reported usual amount of sleep; that is, the former minus the latter, so that a positive delta indicated getting more sleep than usual. The second-order polynomial expansion of the sleep delta (i.e. sleep delta and delta-squared) was included in the linear regression models to test for a quadratic effect: one might expect that sleep- ing much more than usual, or much less than usual, would have similar effects.

The second-order polynomial expansion of the sleep delta (i.e. sleep delta and delta-squared) was included in the linear regression models to test for a quadratic effect: one might expect that sleep- ing much more than usual, or much less than usual, would have similar effects. We also included typical sleep duration (and its square), and the interaction between typical sleep duration and sleep delta to account for the fact that the impact of deviating from a regular amount of sleep would likely depend on what the regular amount was. Four regressors were required to model this interaction (i.e. the expansion of the two second-order factors). Age, gender, education, and frequencies of anxiety- and depres- sion-related episodes were included as covariates of no interest. To statistically test the relationship between test perfor- mance and specific factors of interest (e.g. age, sleep duration, and their interaction), LR tests were used to compare a full model that included all regressors to a reduced (nested) model that did not contain the set of regressors for an effect of inter- est. Calculated effect sizes include R2 (the difference in vari- ance accounted for between the full and reduced models) and Cohens f 2 (the proportion of variance uniquely accounted for by the full model) [30]. Results were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05 when Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons. However, Wild et al. | 3 Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/41/12/zsy182/5096067 by guest on 01 February 2026 given that performance across tests was correlated (and hence the 16 measures were not completely independent), we esti- mated the effective number of comparisons using a method based on the variance of the eigenvalues derived from the cor- relation matrix of all 16 scores [31]. The estimated effective number of tests was 14.27, which corresponds to a conserva- tive p-value significance threshold of 0.0035. It was expected that many effects, including trivial relationships, might appear statistically significant given the large sample size [", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 16474, "end_char": 18952}, {"chunk_id": "wild2018dissociable_chunk_011", "source_id": "wild2018dissociable", "text": "41/12/zsy182/5096067 by guest on 01 February 2026 given that performance across tests was correlated (and hence the 16 measures were not completely independent), we esti- mated the effective number of comparisons using a method based on the variance of the eigenvalues derived from the cor- relation matrix of all 16 scores [31]. The estimated effective number of tests was 14.27, which corresponds to a conserva- tive p-value significance threshold of 0.0035. It was expected that many effects, including trivial relationships, might appear statistically significant given the large sample size [32], so we performed additional analyses to better characterize statisti- cal relationships. First, scores were expressed in SD units which makes it possible to interpret differences like a distance based effect size (like Cohens d). Second, when possible we estimated the Bayes factor in favor of the null (BF01) and alternative (BF10) hypotheses for each effect using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) approximation [33]. This method compares two models like the LR test, but heavily penalizes model complex- ity given a large sample size. That is, it becomes more stringent as the sample size increases, and therefore tiny effect sizes are less likely to result in a rejection of the null hypothesis [34]. We interpret the calculated Bayes factors using Wagenmakers [33] heuristic, where BFs 13, 320, 20150, and >150 constitute weak, positive, strong, and very strong evidence, respectively, for the given hypothesis. To visualize the relationship between predictors (e.g. typi- cal duration, sleep delta) and cognitive performance, predicted score curves and their confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from the estimated regression models by substituting a design matrix containing the prediction interval of interest (e.g. typi- cal sleep duration from 3 to 12 hours) and the mean value of the population for every other factor. These marginal plots show the expected cognitive score across a range of values for a given variable (e.g. typical sleep duration) while holding all other vari- ables constant (to their mean value in our sample). The x-coordi- nate of a parabolas vertex (e.g. the optimal amount of sleep) was simply calculated as x B A = 2 where A was the estimated coef- ficient for the variable-squared term, and B was the coefficient for the linear term. 95% CI", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 18355, "end_char": 20747}, {"chunk_id": "wild2018dissociable_chunk_012", "source_id": "wild2018dissociable", "text": " duration from 3 to 12 hours) and the mean value of the population for every other factor.

To test whether the effect of typical sleep duration differed between the three cognitive domains (STM, reasoning, and verbal ability), a linear mixed effects model was constructed that mod- eled the three domain scores as repeated measurements for each subject. In addition to the random intercept for each subject, the model included the covariates described above, a set of dummy regressors to code the cognitive domain for each score (N = 2), and the interactions between domain and all other factors. These interactions were included because there is evidence that these cognitive domains are differently affected by age, education, gender, and level of anxiety [29]. The mixed-effects model was estimated using maximum likelihood, instead of restricted maxi- mum likelihood, to facilitate significance tests of fixed effects. F-tests, implemented as a Wald test using an F distribution, were used to test specific hypotheses: the overall two-way interaction between sleep duration and cognitive domain, and the simple two-way interactions contrasting pairs of cognitive domains. Results Figure 1 shows the distributions for age, typical sleep duration, and the length of the previous nights sleep, and their relation- ships. Increasing age was associated with less sleep per night in the past month (Figure 1A), and less sleep the night prior to testing (Figure 1B). These two measures of sleep duration were correlated (Figure 1C).

First, we repeated the previous analysis including only those participants who reported typical sleep durations within 1.5 SDs of the mean, to investigate whether the U-shaped relationship was driven by poor performers with very low or high amounts of sleep. This yielded a similar pattern of results (Supplementary Table S7), suggesting the relationship was not driven by poor performing subjects in the tails. We also Table 1.

This again produced the same pattern of results (Supplementary Figure S2, Supplementary Table S8). What is the optimal amount of sleep? From parameter estimates of composite score models, we calcu- lated the x-coordinate of the inflection point for each fitted curve (i.e. the numbers of hours slept resulting in peak performance in our population; Figure 3), and 95% CIs around this point. The optimal amount of sleep was found to be 7.16 (95% CI = 6.78 7.74), 7.44 (95% CI = 6.928.43), and 7.38 (95% CI = 7.027.91) hours for reasoning, verbal, and overall abilities, respectively. Figure 4 shows the difference between performance for a given sleep duration and maximum performance, with 95% CIs of the difference, for all four composite scores. This figure shows, for example, that reasoning, verbal, and overall perfor- mance scores for participants who reportedly slept only 4 hours per night were on average 0.20, 0.20, and 0.26 SDs lower, respec- tively, than participants who slept the optimal amount (reason- ing: t(10865) = 7.94, p < 0.001; verbal t(10865) = 7.19, p < 0.001, overall t(10865) = 10.55, p < 0.001). For context, this difference corresponds to an increase in age of 9.04, 17.0, or 7.86 years for these three scores. Figure 4 also indicates that we could reliably detect an impairment (i.e. a difference from optimal performance, p < 0.05 uncorrected) for 5.97, 6.06", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 28158, "end_char": 30059}, {"chunk_id": "wild2018dissociable_chunk_019", "source_id": "wild2018dissociable", "text": "65) = 7.94, p < 0.001; verbal t(10865) = 7.19, p < 0.001, overall t(10865) = 10.55, p < 0.001). For context, this difference corresponds to an increase in age of 9.04, 17.0, or 7.86 years for these three scores. Figure 4 also indicates that we could reliably detect an impairment (i.e. a difference from optimal performance, p < 0.05 uncorrected) for 5.97, 6.06, and 6.26 hours of sleep for reasoning, verbal, and overall scores. In our sample, 48.9% of participants reported getting typically less than 6.30 hours of sleep per night in the past month. Are cognitive domains affected differently? An F-test revealed a significant cognitive domain (three levels STM, Reasoning, Verbal ability) by sleep duration overall inter- action (F(4,32602) = 4.06, p < 0.005), suggesting that sleep affected the three domains differently. Follow-up tests indicated sig- nificant simple two-way interactions such that the relation- ship between sleep duration and performance differed between reasoning and STM (F(2,32602) = 5.90, p < 0.005) and verbal and STM (F(2,32602) = 5.53, p < 0.005), but not between reasoning and verbal domains. Figure 3 illustrates the difference in the quadratic fit between STM and the reasoning and verbal domains. Does the relationship between sleep and cognition depend on age? We did not observe any significant interactions between age and sleep duration (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S1 bot- tom rows). While we cannot accept a nonsignificant interaction as evidence that there is no such effect, the Bayesian analysis of the same data and models (Table 2) suggested that there is very strong evidence in favor of the null hypothesisthat the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive performance does not depend on age. The Bayesian statistics show, for exam- ple, that the pattern of performance across all domains was well over 1000 times more likely to occur if the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive performance did not depend on the participants age.

Does a single nights sleep affect cognition? Examination of the sleep delta effect revealed a signifi- cant relationship with participants overall cognitive per- formance that was quadratic (Table 3, Supplementary Figure S5a). Bayesian statistics provided very strong corre- sponding evidence (BF10 = 390) in favor of this effect (Table 3, Supplementary Figure 5Sb). Inspection of the parameter esti- mates (Supplementary Table S10) showed a negative coefficient of the quadratic sleep delta, implying an inverted U-shaped association. Reasoning scores exhibited a significant quad- ratic effect of sleep delta, but the corresponding Bayes factor suggested very weak evidence in favor of the null hypothesis (BF01 = 1.34) that there was no relationship between sleep delta and reasoning scores. Similarly, there was a significant interac- tion between sleep delta and typical sleep duration for overall performance, yet the Bayesian analysis very strongly supported the null hypothesis (BF01 = 322). The diverging nature of these latter two observationsstatistically significant effects with Bayesian evidence in favor of the null hypothesissuggests that these might be trivial results (i.e. tiny effects detected only because of the large sample). Figure 5 shows predicted cognitive performance as a func- tion of sleep delta (i.e. the marginal effect of sleep delta while holding all else constant) for overall and (for comparisons sake) reasoning abilities. The location of the maximum occurred at a delta of 1.30 hours (95% CI = 0.235 to 7.377) and 1.18 hours (95% CI = 0.2492.762) for reasoning and overall scores, respec- tively. This implies that sleeping around 1.18 hours more than usual was associated with best overall cognitive performance; however, sleeping less than the usual amount, or sleeping more than 2.76 hours more than usual (i.e. the upper 95% CI or the delta maximum), was associated with decreasing performance", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 31160, "end_char": 33640}, {"chunk_id": "wild2018dissociable_chunk_021", "source_id": "wild2018dissociable", "text": " sake) reasoning abilities.

Given that the average amount of typical sleep for our sample was 6.41 hours, and that the optimal amount of sleep for overall cognitive performance was found to be between 7.027.91 hours, this finding suggests that cognitive performance is better given a night of sleep that is closer to the optimal amount than usual. In other words, sleeping closer to 7 to 8 hours on a given night was associated with better overall cognition. Figure 2.

We observed no interaction between gender and sleep duration, and the Bayesian analysis provided very strong evidence that the U-shaped relationship between sleep and cognition did not depend on gender. Discussion With this massive online study, we have demonstrated that per- formance on a wide range of complex and cognitively demand- ing tasks is related to the reported typical number of hours slept per night in a large and diverse sample of over 10 000 people. Our results suggested that people who regularly slept more or less than 78 hours a night had impairments in their overall cognition, and in their reasoning and verbal abilities. In our data, roughly half of all people reported regularly sleeping 6.3 hours per night or less, and had detectable impairments in overall cognition. For those who slept even lessfour hours per nightthe impairment was equivalent to adding almost 8 years to their age. Importantly, not all tests and cognitive domains were equally affected by the amount of sleep: participants reasoning and verbal abilities were observed to have a similar and reliable inverted-U shaped relationship with the number of hours slept, whereas this pattern was significantly different for STM. In fact, the evidence favored the null hypothesis that there was no rela- tionship between STM performance and reported hours of sleep. This dissociation suggests that regular sleep patterns impact only some higher-order cognitive processes, like the ability to identify complex patterns and manipulate information to solve problems, but has a lesser effect on basic memory processes. STM performance was associated with other factors, like age, gender, and level of anxiety, so it seems unlikely that this meas- ure was simply not sensitive to the effects of sleep. Furthermore, the statistically reliable interaction rules out less interesting explanations that would affect performance across all tasks. For example, if people who dont get enough sleep simply could not focus on the task at hand they would be expected to perform worse across all cognitive domains. It is also unlikely to be a residual effect of age (considering that older people tended to Figure 3.

And, the effect cannot be a result of fatigue over the course of the session because the test order was randomized for every participant. It is interesting that the high-level cognitive processes we found to be associated with sleep duration are different from those that seem to be most affected by short-term total SD; meta-analyses [79] have suggested that short-term and work- ing memory are more impaired by total SD than reasoning. On the other hand, it has been suggested that chronic partial sleep restriction has a greater impact on (broadly defined) cognitive function than total SD [36].

A similar pattern has been reported previ- ously [37], but the current results demonstrate that this sleep delta affords a benefit or disadvantage depending on whether the change was towards or away from the optimal amount of sleep. These results are consistent with the idea of a sleep debt, in that impairment begins to build up after a single night of restricted sleep (i.e. deviating from the optimal), and that cog- nition begins to recover as sleep duration returns to normal [4]. This suggests that people who have chronically too little or too much sleep might see a cognitive improvement with as little as one night of better sleep, whereas one night of poor sleep might well negatively impact a typically good sleeper. While the relationship between too little sleep and cognitive impairment is perhaps unsurprising, it is less clear why too much sleep would produce a similar deficit. A negative effect of nightly sleep in excess of 8 hours is consistent with other similar cross- sectional studies [1115], and is often attributed to known cor- relates of long sleep duration such as depression, failing health, increased morbidity risk, and decreased physical fitness [3840]. However, we controlled for self-reports of depressive episodes in our analysis, and there is no obvious reason why other such fac- tors would affect specific cognitive domains, and not just overall cognitive performance (i.e. the interaction helps rule out factors that would be expected to affect performance on all tests). A more interesting interpretation is that impaired cognition seen in long sleepers is actually driven by too much sleep; for example, longer sleep is associated with longer and more intense sleep inertia [41], which has been shown to produce impairments in high-level cognitive domains, like decision making [42]. Future work could investigate how cognition varies as a function of sleep duration, wake time, and the amount of time between waking and testing. The wide age range of our sample allowed us to test whether the relationship between reported sleep duration and cognitive performance varied as a function of age, but we found no evi- dence for such an interaction. In fact, the data were strongly in favor of the null hypothesisthat the shape and location of the inverted-U association is constant across the lifespan.

In fact, the data were strongly in favor of the null hypothesisthat the shape and location of the inverted-U association is constant across the lifespan. Put simply, the amount of sleep that results in optimal cognitive performance (78 hours), and the impact of deviating from this amount, was the same for everyoneregardless of age. Somewhat counter-intui- tively, this implies that older adults who slept more or less than the optimal amount were impacted no more than younger adults who had non-optimal sleep. If sleep is especially important for staving off dementia and age-related cognitive decline [17], then one might predict that a lack of sleep (or too much sleep) would be associated with more pronounced cognitive impairment in the elderly than in younger adults. Nonetheless, given that 78 hours of sleep was associated with optimal cognition for all ages and that increasing age was associated with less sleep, older populations in general would likely benefit from more sleep. The age-invariant relationship between sleep and cognition that we observed is consistent with another recent large-scale study [43], that found a negative association between sleep and general cog- nitive performance, but little evidence that the effect depended on age. As far as we know, these are the only two reports that examine the interaction of sleep, cognition, and age within the same study. By far, most studies of the relationship between sleep duration and cognition focus on middle-aged to older popula- tions [8, 12, 13, 15, 37, 44], yet our finding that 78 hours of sleep was associated with optimal cognitive performance is consistent with all of them. One caveat to this conclusion is that our analysis may not have been sensitive to a difference in more senior par- ticipants because: (1) the number of volunteers over the age of 70 was low (N = 269) and (2) the interaction model assumed that the parameters of the quadratic curve would vary smoothly with age, whereas there could be a more sudden change in this relation- ship during early and later stages of life", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 43132, "end_char": 45681}, {"chunk_id": "wild2018dissociable_chunk_028", "source_id": "wild2018dissociable", "text": " [8, 12, 13, 15, 37, 44], yet our finding that 78 hours of sleep was associated with optimal cognitive performance is consistent with all of them.

The current results warrant further investigation, perhaps harnessing a large-scale within-subjects experimental design. A second potential limitation is that our primary meas- ures of sleep duration relied entirely on subjective self-report. Validation studies that have compared subjective to objective measures of average sleep duration have found that they were moderately correlated [46, 47], that people tended to over-report how much they actually slept, and that over-report was greater for people who actually slept less [47]. If this were the case in our study, then our results would slightly overestimate the size of the sleep-related effect on cognition and the optimal amount of sleep. It has also been suggested [48] that self-reports of sleep duration are most unreliable for very low and high reported amounts of sleep (i.e. in the tails); one reason may be that mental health factors might be associated with very high or low (and inaccurate) estimates of sleep duration [39, 49, 50]. Hence, cognitive impairments due to these factors would give rise to an apparent inverted U-shaped association with reported sleep duration. However, we attempted to control for mental health problems, and, critically, a supplementary analysis that removed the tails of the reported sleep duration (i.e. included only par- ticipants within 1.5 SDs of the mean) yielded similar results. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that cognitive perfor- mance is associated with a self-reported measure of average nightly sleep duration, but the pattern of this association is dif- ferent across specific cognitive domains. Reasoning and verbal ability exhibited a reliable inverted-U shaped relationship with this measure of sleep, such that the optimal amount of sleep was found between 7 and 8 hours and worse performance was associated with more or less sleep than this amount; this pat- tern was different for short-term memory performance, which exhibited no association at all.

Interestingly, the average amount of sleep reported by our population was less than 7 hours and those that slept slightly more than their usual amount the night before testing performed better, suggesting that many of us might benefit from a single nights good sleep of 78 hours. These findings have significant real-world implications, because many people, including those in positions of responsibility, operate on very little sleep and hence may suffer from impaired reasoning, problem-solving, and communications skills on a daily basis. The scale of this work paves the way for continuing investigations into how day-to-day sleep patterns, and varia- tions in sleep, affect high-level cognitive functioning in the gen- eral population.

Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, VIP, and the Wanfang data knowledge service platforms from inception to 31 July 2022. Cohort and casecontrol studies assessing the relationship between night-sleep duration and depression were selected. We used the NewcastleOttawa scale to assess the quality of the published research. Two researchers carried out data extraction and quality assessment. The restricted cubic spline function and generalized least squares method were used to establish doseresponse relationships between sleep duration and depression. We aimed to analyze the estimated effect size presented as the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% condence interval (CI) using Stata 12.0. Result: Six cohort studies with 33,595 participants were included in this meta-analysis. A U-shaped association between sleep duration and depression risk was revealed. On one hand, compared with 7-h of night sleep, both shorter and longer sleep duration were associated with an increased risk of depression (5 h: risk ratio = 1.09, 95% condence interval = 1.071.12; 6 h: RR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.021.04; 8 h: RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.051.15; 9 h: RR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.171.47; 10 h: RR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.311.92; non-linear test p < 0.05). On the other hand, an increased risk of depression with shorter sleep duration was observed in middle-aged and older people among the non- Asian population (5 h: RR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.021.17), while both shorter and longer sleep duration can increase the risk of depression among an Asian population (5 h: RR =", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 0, "end_char": 2079}, {"chunk_id": "li2023relationship_chunk_002", "source_id": "li2023relationship", "text": " h: RR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.171.47; 10 h: RR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.311.92; non-linear test p < 0.05). On the other hand, an increased risk of depression with shorter sleep duration was observed in middle-aged and older people among the non- Asian population (5 h: RR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.021.17), while both shorter and longer sleep duration can increase the risk of depression among an Asian population (5 h: RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.071.13; 6 h: RR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.021.05; 8 h: RR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.051.14; 9 h: RR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.181.53; 10 h: RR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.362.12). Conclusion: The lowest-risk onset of depression occurred among middle-aged and older people with 7 h of night sleep, which suggested that shorter and longer night-sleep duration might lead to an increased incidence of depression.

Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org 01 TYPE Systematic Review PUBLISHED 02 March 2023 DOI 10.3389/fphys.2023.1085091 1 Introduction With the aging of the global population, mental health conditions such as depression have received greater emphasis among the middle-aged and older population. In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) pointed out that depression had become the third leading cause of the global disease burden and would develop into the largest by 2030 (Malhi and Mann, 2018). Meanwhile, depression is a recurrent mental disorder in middle- aged and older people, greatly impacting an individuals psychosocial function. Depression is associated with numerous adverse health problems (e.g., disability, physical impairment, coronary heart disease, and increased mortality) (Carney and Freedland, 2017; Wu et al., 2023) and may threaten their lives and reduce their quality of life. In view of the depression-related high-level global health burden and economic burden (Bao et al., 2017; Paudel et al., 2013; van MILL et al., 2014), the occurrence of depression in middle-aged and older people has gradually captured more attention (Kang et al., 2020). Previous meta-analyses reported depression prevalence in middle-aged and older", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 2932, "end_char": 5172}, {"chunk_id": "li2023relationship_chunk_004", "source_id": "li2023relationship", "text": "e.g., disability, physical impairment, coronary heart disease, and increased mortality) (Carney and Freedland, 2017; Wu et al., 2023) and may threaten their lives and reduce their quality of life. In view of the depression-related high-level global health burden and economic burden (Bao et al., 2017; Paudel et al., 2013; van MILL et al., 2014), the occurrence of depression in middle-aged and older people has gradually captured more attention (Kang et al., 2020). Previous meta-analyses reported depression prevalence in middle-aged and older adults ranging from 8% to 16%, while the global prevalence of depression was 4.7% (4.4%5.0%) (Cole and Dendukuri, 2003; Ferrari et al., 2013). Although several effective treatments for depression are available, more than 75% of patients from low- and middle-income countries do not receive any therapies (Evans-Lacko et al., 2018). However, only 30%50% of the older patients accepting treatment can achieve remission (Lee et al., 2013). Hence, there is still a lack of health resources or timely diagnosis for middle-aged and older people who suffer from depression. In this situation, identifying modiable risk factors for depression may provide implications for depression- related prognosis and primary prevention. Many factors can account for depression, such as demographic and sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, gender, and lack of social support), and behavioral and psychosocial factors (e.g., low cognitive function, insufcient physical activity, and living alone) (Kang et al., 2020; Jiang and Chu, 2021). Insufcient sleep, short night-sleep duration, insomnia, and sleep disorders are highly relevant to high-risk depression (Paudel et al., 2013; van MILL et al., 2014; Fernandez-Mendoza et al., 2015; Gehrman et al., 2013). The relationship between sleep duration and depression is bidirectional and complex. On one hand, extreme sleep time is usually considered a symptom of depression. On the other hand, poor sleep is not only a symptom but also a risk factor for depression (Mendlewicz, 2009; Wiebe et al., 2012). Nocturnal sleep is a health- promoting physical process that plays a fundamental role in", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 4627, "end_char": 6793}, {"chunk_id": "li2023relationship_chunk_005", "source_id": "li2023relationship", "text": " relevant to high-risk depression (Paudel et al., 2013; van MILL et al., 2014; Fernandez-Mendoza et al., 2015; Gehrman et al., 2013).

On the other hand, poor sleep is not only a symptom but also a risk factor for depression (Mendlewicz, 2009; Wiebe et al., 2012). Nocturnal sleep is a health- promoting physical process that plays a fundamental role in physical and mental tness (Luyster et al., 2012). The incidence of sleep insufciency is common in older people (Ancoli-Israel, 2005). Many cohort and cross-sectional studies showed a relationship between sleep duration and depression (Szklo-Coxe et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2020), and short sleep duration can increase the incidence of depression in adolescents (Gangwisch et al., 2010), adults (Watson et al., 2014), and older adults (Putilov, 2013). In addition, a U-shaped relationship between survival and actigraphically measured sleep duration, including short and long durations, was found (Kripke et al., 2011). In other words, long sleepers were also at risk for depression (Ford and Kamerow, 1989; Watson et al., 2015). Another Chinese study reported older people who slept more than 10 h per night had the highest risk of depression and major depressive disorder in rural areas (Jiang et al., 2020). Notably, the aforementioned research demonstrated a non-linear relationship between sleep duration and depression, but their conclusions about whether long or short sleep duration could induce depression were inconsistent. More importantly, few meta- analyses focused on cohort studies have been carried out to explore quantitative length of sleep duration and their impact on the risk of depression. The study aims to analyze the relationship between night-sleep duration and the risk of depression through a doseresponse meta- analysis based on cohort and casecontrol studies that quantitatively describe how night-sleep time inuences the risk of depression in a bid to offer some clues to prevention for depression. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Search strategy First, we systematically searched eligible studies, including cohort and casecontrol studies, in PubMed, Embase,", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 6277, "end_char": 8580}, {"chunk_id": "li2023relationship_chunk_006", "source_id": "li2023relationship", "text": " depression were inconsistent.

Second, a series of topic- related editorials, perspectives, methodology, and comments were also reviewed for potentially useful information. Third, other relevant studies were manually investigated as the supplement literature. Our search terms encompassed sleep duration, sleep time, sleep disorders, night sleep, sleepiness, sleep pattern, and depression. Details of the systematic search are shown in Supplementary Table S1. 2.2 Selected criteria The following original studies were considered for this meta- analysis: 1) middle-aged or older people as subjects; 2) epidemiological studies based on cohort population, casecontrol, and cross-sectional studies; 3) sleep duration with more than three exposure categories; 4) depression regarded as the endpoint for evaluation; 5) study providing odds ratio (OR), risk ratio (RR), or hazard ratio (HR) with 95% condence intervals (CIs), or other sufcient data to estimate these values. The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) studies without full text available (conference proceedings) and review articles; 2) studies missing vital data for meta-analysis (e.g., number of cases, follow-up duration, RR/OR/HR value, and their 95% CIs) and inaccessible to contact with authors via email or telephone. 2.3 Data extraction After two rounds of literature screening (titleabstract and full- text review) by two authors (Li XL and Zhang XY) independently in accord with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, irrelevant studies were removed.

The NOS scale consists of three dimensions and eight items: four items for the selection of study subjects, one item for comparability between/ among groups, and the remainder (three items) for measuring endpoint or exposure factors. Except for one item with possible two points for comparability, the others can have either one or no points as the highest score. Cohort studies had a maximum score of 9. Studies with a total score equal to or more than seven are considered high certainty, while studies with scores between four and six were dened as fair. Studies with a total score of less than four were considered low certainty (Stang, 2010). The third investigator (Zhu WT) made decisions when disagreements or questions arose. 2.5 Data analysis First, the RR and its 95% CI were employed to estimate effect size, during which log (RR) was calculated by the RR values provided. If different effect sizes appeared in the included studies, OR and HR were directly treated as RR (Orsini et al., 2012). When studies reported multiple adjusted RR values, we extracted the most adjusted estimates. In line with the theory proposed by Greenland and Longnecker (1992), an MS Excel macro document (Hamling et al., 2008) was used to convert the lowest dose group set as a reference substance. When the lowest and the highest dose group were in an open interval, the length of the interval was dened as that of the adjacent groups, and the middle point of the interval was taken as the average exposure dose (Orsini et al., 2006). If the mean or median of the sleep duration group was not reported in the original text, the median of the upper and lower boundaries of the group was used instead. When including studies that had other missing data, we estimated those data with reference to previous studies (Bekkering et al., 2008). Second, data from the highest and lowest dose groups in the included studies were extracted for highlow meta-analysis. When p < 0.05, there was a statistical difference in the", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 13190, "end_char": 15514}, {"chunk_id": "li2023relationship_chunk_011", "source_id": "li2023relationship", "text": " adjacent groups, and the middle point of the interval was taken as the average exposure dose (Orsini et al., 2006). If the mean or median of the sleep duration group was not reported in the original text, the median of the upper and lower boundaries of the group was used instead. When including studies that had other missing data, we estimated those data with reference to previous studies (Bekkering et al., 2008). Second, data from the highest and lowest dose groups in the included studies were extracted for highlow meta-analysis. When p < 0.05, there was a statistical difference in the risk of depression between the highest and lowest dose groups regarding night-sleep duration. In view of the aforesaid statistical differences, meta- regression was performed using the three-node restricted cubic spline (RCS) to t the potential non-linear trend. The three knots were at 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles of the distribution. The generalized least-square method was used to estimate the parameters. Afterward, the common comparative category for the exposure was set to 7 h (von Ruesten et al., 2012). Compared with the reference dose, the RR and the 95% CI that described the relationship between different exposure doses and depression were estimated. Third, the independent variable, night-sleep duration, was treated as a continuous variable in our study, and the log (OR) of depression was the dependent variable. The Wald test was used to determine non-linearity. The relationship between the two variables was considered to be a non-linear doseresponse if p < 0.05. If a U, J, or S-shape of the non-linear model was observed, two piecewise treatments were respectively performed with the lowest point of the curve to show a trend identied as linearity (Xu et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2017). Statistical heterogeneity was measured by Cochrans Q-test employing the I2 value (Higgins and Thompson, 2002). Q statistics with p < 0.1 presented heterogeneity. Meanwhile, if heterogeneity was indicated by I2 50% (Kang and Xu, 2015), then the random-effects model was applied. In contrast, the xed- effect model approach was applied to estimate the coefcient.

We executed a subgroup analysis considering different confounding factors such as gender and study location. Eggers and Beggs tests were employed to assess whether publication bias existed when more than 10 studies were included. Otherwise, neither Beggs nor Eggers test was carried out. For studies reporting unadjusted effect sizes or those of fair quality, sensitivity analysis (leave-one-out method) was utilized to quantify the distinction between before and after removing a single study. For all the tests except the Q-test, p-values of 0.05 were considered signicant, using STATA version 12.0 (STATA Corporation, College Station, Texas, United States of America). 2.6 Registration and reporting We conducted the meta-analysis according to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) checklist (Stroup et al., 2000). The meta-analysis was registered on the PROSPERO platform (CRD42022344052). 3 Results 3.1 Description of studies After preliminary searches in the databases mentioned previously, 19,935 studies were identied. After the rst screening of the ineligible articles, we retrieved full-text papers of 348 studies for further identication. Of these, 341 studies were excluded according to the inclusion criteria. Finally, we included six cohort studies through cross- sectional investigation enrolling 33,595 participants (Yokoyama et al., 2010; Lippman et al., 2017; Li, 2018; Reis et al., 2018; Lai et al., 2020; Zhou, 2021). Figure 1 shows the selection process. These studies were published between 2010 and 2021. The details of their characteristics are shown in Table 1. The follow-up durations were 39 years. The sample size of cohort studies ranged from 1,110 to 16,104. Three of these cohort studies were carried out in China (Li, 2018; Lai et al., 202", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 16699, "end_char": 18886}, {"chunk_id": "li2023relationship_chunk_013", "source_id": "li2023relationship", "text": " 2010; Lippman et al., 2017; Li, 2018; Reis et al., 2018; Lai et al., 2020; Zhou, 2021).

The sample size of cohort studies ranged from 1,110 to 16,104. Three of these cohort studies were carried out in China (Li, 2018; Lai et al., 2020; Zhou, 2021), and one each in America (Lippman et al., 2017), Portugal (Reis et al., 2018), and Japan (Yokoyama et al., 2010). These studies recruited men and women. Only one study reported the results of men and women separately (Li, 2018). In terms of the depression measurement, three studies considered the Center for Epidemiological Survey, Depression Scale (CES-D) as the diagnosed standard (Yokoyama et al., 2010; Lippman et al., 2017; Li, 2018), one study diagnosed depression based on the Geriatric Depression Scale (Zhou, 2021), and one study (Lai et al., 2020) used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as diagnostic instruments. Only one study did not report the diagnostic criteria for depression (Reis et al., 2018). The risk of bias (accessed by NOS proposed previously) of the included studies was Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org 04 Li et al. 10.3389/fphys.2023.1085091 generally good; three studies were considered fair because of failure to ascertain exposure, short length of follow-up, and outcome of interest not present at the start of the study.

The xed-effect model was used for consolidation because of heterogeneity (I2 = 0.0% and p = 0.884). The results showed that there was a statistically signicant difference in the risk of depression between long sleep and short sleep (RR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.031.56; p = 0.000; Figure 2). Because there were statistical differences in the risk of depression in the long and short sleep time groups, a doseresponse meta- analysis was conducted for the six cohort studies. There was a non- linear relationship estimating a U-shaped curve between sleep duration and the risk of depression in middle-aged and older people (non-linear test p < 0.05; Figure 3). When the sleep duration was 7 h, the risk of depression was the lowest. Compared to 7 h, shorter and longer sleep durations were signicantly associated with the risk of depression during night- sleep time (5 h: RR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.071.12; 6 h: RR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.021.04; 8 h: RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.051.15; 9 h: RR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.171.47; 10 h: RR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.311.92). 3.3 Subgroup analyses of night-sleep duration and depression The association between the duration of night sleep and the incidence of depression may be inconsistent in middle-aged and older people of different genders and from different regions, so a subgroup analysis was required.

We examined the effect through applied subgroup analysis based on the gender and region. Compared to 7 h, a shorter duration of 5 h led to an increased risk of depression in a non-Asian older population (RR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.021.17). Among older Asian adults, sleeping less than and more than 7 h was associated with an increased risk of depression (5 h: RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.071.13; 6 h: RR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.021.05; 8 h: RR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.051.14; 9 h: RR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.181.53; 10 h: RR = 1.70, 95%CI = 1.362.12).

After excluding fair-quality studies (n = 3), there was no particular study with a signicant impact on the overall estimates under sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Figure S1). 3.5 Publication bias Due to the small number of included studies (<10), we did not conduct a visual inspection of Beggs funnel plot or statistical Beggs and Eggers tests for detecting publication bias. 4 Discussion 4.1 Summary of ndings Evidence of a doseresponse association between night-sleep duration and depression has been inconsistent and limited. We conducted this study to investigate the non-linear impact of sleep duration on depression in middle-aged and older people. We performed a doseresponse meta-analysis based on cohort studies with an average sleep duration of 5 to 10 h. Our results suggested that the incidence of depression was related to sleep duration, with a doseresponse relationship between night-sleep duration and the risk of depression. Compared with 7 h, both shorter and longer sleep duration could inuence the risk of depression. The signicant association remained the same in subgroup analyses. Further subgroup analysis of regions showed that short sleep duration increased the risk of depression, regardless of race (Asian and non-Asian populations), while sleepers with a longer duration from Asia also gained a signicantly increased risk of depression. Therefore, regulating sleep duration is important for the prevention and intervention of depression. FIGURE 2 High-low meta-analysis forest chart between sleep duration and depression risk.

FIGURE 2 High-low meta-analysis forest chart between sleep duration and depression risk.

Sleep disturbances that include insomnia, poor sleep qualities, and sleep complaints (Yaffe et al., 2014) were classied according to symptoms, questionnaires, and diagnoses. A previous review of 34 cohort studies investigating the relationship between insomnia and depression showed that sleep difculty was signicantly associated with depression (Li et al., 2016), which suggested that individuals experiencing insomnia may be at higher risk of depression than people who sleep for a longer duration. Furthermore, some meta-analyses emphasized depression and poor sleep quality as an unfavorable effect on older individuals (Becker et al., 2017). Bao et al. (2017), including 23 cohort studies, reported that sleep disturbances were associated with an increased risk of depression. Zhai et al. (2015) indicated that both shorter and longer sleep duration, without reporting baseline sleep time, were signicantly associated with an increased risk of depression in adults. However, these studies did not report the impact of specic sleep duration on the risk of depression. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis using a exible, non-linear, meta-regression approach, which showed our results were consistent with previous meta-analyses: both long and short night-sleep duration contribute to a risk of depression. Concretely, toward gender analysis, shorter sleep duration contributes to a higher risk of depression (Li, 2018). 4.3 Relationship between sleep duration and depression Depression is related to decreased regional gray matter volume, which might partly be explained by an unhealthier lifestyle in depressed individuals (Binnewies et al., 2021).

Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org 07 Li et al. 10.3389/fphys.2023.1085091 Undoubtedly, the length of sleep is vital for inammation, glucose regulation, energy expenditure, and cognitive development. One possible explanation of sleep duration regarded as an intermediary variable of depression is that continuous changes in the arousal system accompanied by stress will cause sleep problems. When these changes become normal, the emotional regulation or cognitive system functions will gradually change, resulting in depression symptoms (Magnusson et al., 2014). Short sleep may increase daytime physical or psychological fatigue (Shen et al., 2006), promoting the onset of depression, which leads to biological cycle rhythm disorder or causes endocrine hormone changes (Germain and Kupfer, 2008; van Noorden et al., 2012; Luik et al., 2015). The bi-directional relationship between insomnia and depression has previously been established (Bao et al., 2017; Nutt et al., 2008). Furthermore, people who sleep for a long time still have a risk of depression, which may be correlated with low physical activity (Str", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 26153, "end_char": 28023}, {"chunk_id": "li2023relationship_chunk_019", "source_id": "li2023relationship", "text": "). Short sleep may increase daytime physical or psychological fatigue (Shen et al., 2006), promoting the onset of depression, which leads to biological cycle rhythm disorder or causes endocrine hormone changes (Germain and Kupfer, 2008; van Noorden et al., 2012; Luik et al., 2015). The bi-directional relationship between insomnia and depression has previously been established (Bao et al., 2017; Nutt et al., 2008). Furthermore, people who sleep for a long time still have a risk of depression, which may be correlated with low physical activity (Stranges et al., 2008). Decreased activity will reduce the level of neurotransmitters (especially dopamine and serotonin), the transmission of aminergic brain synapses (Weicker and Struder, 2001), and endorphin secretion (Janal et al., 1984), which will increase the risk of depression (Paluska and Schwenk, 2000). 4.4 Relationship between gender and depression Previous studies found that women are more likely to be affected by sleep duration, implying that gender could be another risk factor for depression (Wang et al., 2016). Women are more susceptible to the synergistic effect of hormones than men (such as estrogen) during most stages (viz. puberty, premenstrual period, postpartum period, and the transitional period of perimenopause), so they are prone to be exposed to depression (Janowsky and Rausch, 1985). Because only one study reported results for men and women separately, it is not enough to draw an accurate conclusion about the relationship between different genders and depression. Further research investigating the impact of sleep duration and depression on gender should be encouraged. 4.5 Strengths and limitations There were a few strengths in this work. First, our review, with a strict inclusion of eligible cohort studies, applied the RCS function to tting the potential non-linear relationship between sleep duration and the risk of depression. To some extent, the results present a cause and effect relationship. In the second place, this manuscript revealed the relationship between specic sleep duration and the risk of depression, which complemented stronger and more sufcient evidence. Lastly, sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the stability of our results, probably affected by underlying confounders, while subgroup analysis was run to detect sources of heterogeneity. As a result, repeated consistency after sensitivity and subgroup analyses indicated that our nd", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 27471, "end_char": 29937}, {"chunk_id": "li2023relationship_chunk_020", "source_id": "li2023relationship", "text": " our review, with a strict inclusion of eligible cohort studies, applied the RCS function to tting the potential non-linear relationship between sleep duration and the risk of depression.

Lastly, sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the stability of our results, probably affected by underlying confounders, while subgroup analysis was run to detect sources of heterogeneity. As a result, repeated consistency after sensitivity and subgroup analyses indicated that our ndings are relatively reliable and robust. However, we must explain our ndings carefully, owing to several limitations. First, this review only includes studies written in Chinese and English and may have language bias. Second, only six cohort studies were entered into the meta-analysis nally, which could affect the power of the results. Due to the limited number of studies included, it was not possible to analyze subgroups according to the number of participants, follow-up years, case sources, etc. Although we adopted subgroup analyses of Asian and non-Asian regions, the small number of included studies in the two regions limited the generalization to a certain extent. Third, this meta-analysis contained cohort studies addressing the relationship between night-sleep duration with the risk of depression, regardless of daytime sleepiness. Sleep duration collected through questionnaires in some studies may be biased, owing to the inaccurate records of older people. The adjusted confounders were different among the included studies. Although we extracted the adjusted risk estimates, it was difcult to avoid information bias derived from original studies. Due to the limited number of related studies, publication bias was not examined. An updated meta-analysis adopting more studies should be undertaken in the future. 5 Conclusion The lowest incidence rate of depression occurs in middle-aged and older people who sleep 7 h a night. Compared with 7-h sleep duration, shorter and longer night-sleep duration could lead to an increased risk for depression. Hence, it is necessary to avoid both oversleeping and under-sleeping to protect individuals against depression.

In the United States, a substantial proportion of adults report sleep durations that fall outside the recommended range. Prior research has associated insufficient or excessive sleep with adverse health outcomes; however, few studies have systematically quantified these associations across multiple health indicators using nationally representative data. Objective This study aims to evaluate the impact of short sleep duration on four key health outcomes: depression diagnosis, number of self-reported poor mental health days, number of physically unhealthy days, and self-rated general health status, using nationally representative U.S. data. Methodology: Methods We analyzed nationally representative data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Sur veillance System (BRFSS) collected between 2016 and 2023. Sleep duration was PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321347 January 14, 2026 2 / 18 self-reported and categorized into three groups: short sleep (5 hours), recom mended sleep (68 hours), and long sleep (9 hours), with short sleep serving as the reference category. The primary health outcomes included: (1) self-reported diagno sis of depression, (2) number of poor mental health days, (3) number of poor physical health days, and (4) self-rated general health, measured on a 5-point", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 1323, "end_char": 3877}, {"chunk_id": "fasokun2026associations_chunk_003", "source_id": "fasokun2026associations", "text": "3. Sleep duration was PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321347 January 14, 2026 2 / 18 self-reported and categorized into three groups: short sleep (5 hours), recom mended sleep (68 hours), and long sleep (9 hours), with short sleep serving as the reference category. The primary health outcomes included: (1) self-reported diagno sis of depression, (2) number of poor mental health days, (3) number of poor physical health days, and (4) self-rated general health, measured on a 5-point Likert scale from excellent to poor. To estimate the effect of sleep duration on these outcomes, we applied Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) to derive the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), adjusting for key demographic and socioeconomic covariates. All analyses incorporated BRFSS complex survey weights to ensure national representativeness. Results The study included 318,000 adults (63.3% female; 74.5% White) with a mean age of 51.3  18.4 years. Among individuals with recommended sleep duration (68 hours), the baseline prevalence of depression was 39.5% (95% CI: 39.4%39.7%). Compared to this group, short sleep duration (5 hours) was associated with a 14.1 percentage point increase in depression incidence (95% CI: 13.8%14.4%), while long sleep duration (9 hours) was linked to a 12.9 percentage point increase (95% CI: 12.5%13.3%). Those with short sleep reported an average of 5.3 poor mental health days (95% CI: 5.35.4), 4.4 poor physical health days (95% CI: 4.34.4), and a higher prevalence of poor general health, 10.0% (0.1, 95% CI: 9.7%10.2%), com pared to individuals with recommended sleep. Similarly, individuals with long sleep duration (9 hours) also reported more poor mental (4.6 days, 95% CI: 4.54.7) and physical health days (3.2 days, 95% CI: 3.13.3), along with a higher prevalence of poor general health, 20.3% (20.3%%, 95% CI 19", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 3376, "end_char": 5237}, {"chunk_id": "fasokun2026associations_chunk_004", "source_id": "fasokun2026associations", "text": "34.4), and a higher prevalence of poor general health, 10.0% (0.1, 95% CI: 9.7%10.2%), com pared to individuals with recommended sleep.

Introduction Sleep is a fundamental biological necessity essential for overall health, cognitive function, and emotional well-being [1,2]. Despite its critical role, sleep depriva tion remains a growing public health concern in the United States [3,4].

National surveys indicate that approximately one in three U.S. adults experience short sleep duration, with even higher prevalence among racial minorities, low-income populations, and those with demanding work schedules [68]. The consequences of insufficient or disrupted sleep extend far beyond personal health, impacting productivity, increasing accident risk, and imposing substantial economic burdens estimated in the billions of dollars annually [912]. Furthermore, sleep deprivation is linked to a lower quality of life, heightened risk of chronic illness, and impaired daily functioning, thereby affecting overall well-being [13,14]. Multiple factors contribute to sleep duration variability in the U.S., including occupational stress, socioeconomic con ditions, behavioral patterns, and comorbid health conditions [1517]. Modern lifestyle disruptions such as prolonged screen exposure, inconsistent sleep routines, and psychosocial stress further intensify this trend [18]. Additionally, sleep disturbances commonly co-occur with mental and physical health disorders such as anxiety, depression, and chronic pain, fostering a bidirectional relationship that compounds health risks [19,20]. Reduced sleep is associated with more frequent poor mental health days, greater emotional distress, and impaired physical functioning [2123]. Consequently, under standing the nuanced relationship between varying levels of sleep and health outcomes is essential to guide effective public health strategies. While existing literature has documented associations between inadequate sleep and adverse health outcomes [24,25], most studies have treated sleep duration as a binary exposure (sufficient vs. insufficient) and have not comprehensively examined a broader range of health impacts across differentiated sleep categories [2628]. Moreover, few studies have concurrently assessed the effects of both short (<6 hours) and long (9 hours) sleep on a wide spectrum of outcomes, including depression", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 6632, "end_char": 9353}, {"chunk_id": "fasokun2026associations_chunk_006", "source_id": "fasokun2026associations", "text": " poor mental health days, greater emotional distress, and impaired physical functioning [2123].

Moreover, few studies have concurrently assessed the effects of both short (<6 hours) and long (9 hours) sleep on a wide spectrum of outcomes, including depression, poor mental and physical health days, and self-rated general health, an important indicator of holis tic well-being [2932]. Recent evidence suggests that both insufficient and excessive sleep durations may be linked to adverse health profiles [33,34], but population-level analyses using representative U.S. data are limited. To address these gaps, this study investigates the association between sleep duration categorized into three distinct groups: short sleep (5 hours), recommended sleep (68 hours), and long sleep (9 hours) and four self-reported health outcomes: incidence of depression, number of poor mental health days, number of poor physical health days, and gen eral health status. By utilizing a nationally representative dataset and advanced causal modeling techniques, we aim to provide robust, population-level estimates that inform public health policies and clinical practices related to sleep hygiene and health promotion. Methodology Study design and data source This study utilizes data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) [35,36], a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey conducted annually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The BRFSS collects health-related data from U.S. adults through telephone-based interviews, providing extensive information on health behav iors, chronic conditions, and healthcare access [37]. Data from 2016 to 2023 were used for this study, providing a broad temporal scope to examine trends and associations between sleep duration, mental health outcomes, and physical activity levels. To assess changes in sleep patterns over time, we conducted a trend analysis using BRFSS data from 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022the years in which the full sleep module was administered nationally. The analytic sample was derived following the flow diagram presented in Fig 1.

Primary explanatory variable: Sleep duration Sleep duration was measured using the BRFSS survey item: On average, how many hours of sleep do you get in a 24-hour period? Respondents provided a numeric value from 1 to 24 hours. For analysis, sleep duration was categorized into three groups: Short sleep (5 hours) [38,39], Recommended sleep (68 hours) [38,40], and Long sleep (9 hours) PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321347 January 14, 2026 4 / 18 [3840]. This categorization was informed by recommendations from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) [41,42] and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [43,44], which endorse 79 hours of sleep as optimal for adult health. In all models, short sleep (5 hours) served as the reference group, allowing comparisons to both recom mended and long sleep durations. Outcome variables The primary outcome variables in this study, drawn from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), include self-reported depression diagnosis, poor mental health days, physically unhealthy days, and general health status. Depression diagnosis Depression status was assessed using the BRFSS chronic condition item: (Ever told) (you had) a depressive disorder (including depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression)? Responses were coded as 1 = Yes and 2 = No. Individuals responding Yes were classified as having a self-reported history of depressive disorder. Non-substantive responsesincluding Dont know/Not sure (code = 7) and Refused (code = 9)were excluded from the analysis. This binary variable was analyzed as a categorical outcome to estimate the association between sleep duration and the likeli hood of depression diagnosis. Fig 1.

Starting with 3,911,129 adult respondents from the 20162023 Behav ioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 1,712,145 participants were excluded due to missing data on sleep duration. An additional 2,788,668 respondents were excluded for missing data on one or more of the four primary outcome variables: depression (n = 1,299,214), poor mental health days (n = 1,190,226), poor physical health days (n = 289,872), and general health status (n = 9,356). The resulting final analytic sample included 318,654 respondents with complete information. These were categorized into: short sleep (5 hours, n = 65,579; 19.7%), recommended sleep (68 hours, n = 224,164; 70.5%), and long sleep (9 hours, n = 31,257; 9.8%). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321347.g001 PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321347 January 14, 2026 5 / 18 Mentally unhealthy days Mentally unhealthy days were assessed using the BRFSS core question: Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good? Responses ranged from 0 to 30 days, reflecting the respondents self-reported number of days with poor mental health in the past month.

This variable was modeled as a continuous outcome to quantify the monthly burden of mental distress among respondents. Physically unhealthy days Physically unhealthy days were assessed using the BRFSS core question: Now thinking about your physical health, which includes physical illness and injury, for how many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not good? Responses ranged from 0 to 30 days, reflecting the number of days respondents experienced poor physical health in the past month. Responses indicating None were coded as 0 days, while non-substantive responses (e.g., Dont know/Not sure = 77, Refused = 99) were treated as missing and excluded from analysis. This variable was modeled as a continu ous outcome to capture variations in physical health burden among participants. General health status Self-rated general health was measured using the standard BRFSS item: Would you say that in general your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor? Responses were captured on a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). For analytical purposes, the variable was treated as a continuous measure, with higher scores indicating poorer self-perceived health. This subjective rating has been widely validated as a reliable indicator of overall health status and a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in population-based research. Covariates and confounder adjustment To minimize confounding and improve the validity of estimated associations between sleep duration and health outcomes, the analysis adjusted for a comprehensive set of demographic and socioeconomic covariates sourced from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). These covariates included: Age group (1834, 3554, and 55 years) Sex (male, female) Body Mass Index (BMI) category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese) Educational attainment (high school or less, some college, college graduate) Household income (<$25,000, $25,000", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 14029, "end_char": 16582}, {"chunk_id": "fasokun2026associations_chunk_010", "source_id": "fasokun2026associations", "text": " in population-based research.

All models were also adjusted for state of residence and survey year to account for geographic and temporal variation in reporting patterns and policy contexts. By including these covariates in the analytic models, the study aimed to more accurately isolate the independent asso ciation between sleep duration and the primary health outcomes of interest.

Although the Results section references PSM conceptually, our approach used IPW  a method within the propensity score framework that achieves covariate balance across treatment groups without the need for matched pairs. The rationale for using IPW was to retain the full sample while reducing selection bias due to non-random assignment of sleep duration categories, allowing for estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE). Propensity scores were estimated via a multinomial logistic regression model, where sleep duration category (short sleep [5 hours], recommended sleep [68 hours], and long sleep [9 hours]) was modeled as a function of observed covariates. The following variables were included in the IPW model based on theoretical and empirical relevance to both sleep patterns and health outcomes: age group, sex (female), race", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 15962, "end_char": 18482}, {"chunk_id": "fasokun2026associations_chunk_011", "source_id": "fasokun2026associations", "text": " balance across treatment groups without the need for matched pairs.

The following variables were included in the IPW model based on theoretical and empirical relevance to both sleep patterns and health outcomes: age group, sex (female), race/ethnicity, BMI category, educational attainment, income category, marital status, U.S. state of residence (stfip), and survey year (iyear).

We applied BRFSS-provided probability weights (_llcpwt) in all models to ensure national representativeness. Balance diagnostics were conducted by comparing standardized mean differences (SMDs) for covariates before and after weight ing. Covariate balance was considered acceptable if SMDs were reduced to below 0.1 following weighting. The use of IPW, rather than traditional matching (e.g., nearest-neighbor), was chosen to avoid sample loss and improve efficiency in a large, complex survey dataset. Robust standard errors were clustered at the state level to account for intra-state correlation.

Sleep duration was operationalized categorically into three treatment groups:  Short sleep:  5 hours (reference group),  Recommended sleep: 68 hours,  Long sleep:  9 hours. We implemented a multinomial logistic regression model to predict sleep category membership based on a rich set of covariates. These included:  Age group (1834, 3554, 55),  Sex (male, female), PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321347 January 14, 2026 7 / 18  Race/ethnicity,  Body Mass Index (BMI) category (underweight, normal, overweight, obese),  Education (high school or less, some college, college graduate),  Household income (<$25K, $2549K, $5099K,  $100K),  Marital status (married, previously married, never married),  State of residence, and  Survey year. Inverse probability weights were then generated from these estimated treatment probabilities and applied to model the expected values of each health outcome. Estimation of effects Each health outcome was modeled as the dependent variable in a weighted regression model:  Depression diagnosis (binary) was analyzed using a weighted linear probability model, allowing for straightforward inter pretation of marginal effects as risk differences.  Poor mental health days, physically unhealthy days, and self-rated general health (continuous) were modeled using weighted mean regressions, assuming normally distributed residuals.

Analyses were conducted using Statas teffects ipw command, and convergence was confirmed through examina tion of estimation criteria. Sensitivity analysis To address reviewer concerns regarding the definition of sleep duration, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which sleep was re-categorized according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. In this re-specification, short sleep was defined as 6 hours, recommended sleep as 79 hours, and long sleep as 10 hours. We re-estimated all primary models using these revised sleep duration categories. The resulting predicted probabilities and regression estimates were summarized in supplementary tables (S1 File).

The total sample included 318,000 individuals. Of these, 65,579 (19.7%) reported sleeping fewer than 6 hours, 224,164 (70.5%) reported sleeping 68 hours, and 31,257 (9.8%) reported sleeping more than 8 hours per night.

Sex differences were also significant. Males, who comprised 36.7% of the overall population, were slightly overrepre sented in the short sleep group (38.1%) but underrepresented in the long sleep group (34.1%). In contrast, females were slightly overrepresented in the long sleep group (65.9%) compared to their overall proportion (63.3%). These differences, however, were marginal. Body Mass Index (BMI) categories showed a significant relationship with sleep duration. The proportion of obese individuals was highest among short sleepers (44.7%) and lowest among those with 68 hours of sleep (37.7%). Normal weight was most common among those with recommended sleep (29.2%). Race/ethnicity distribution significantly differed across sleep duration categories. Among individuals reporting short sleep (5 hours), 69.9% were White, 2.2% Black, 6.7% Hispanic, and 11.3% Other. In contrast, among those with rec ommended sleep (68 hours), 78.3% were White, 7.7% Black, 5.7% Hispanic, and 8.3% Other.

In contrast, college graduates, whose baseline proportion was 34.1%, were slightly overrepresented among those with 68 hours of sleep (38.2%), suggesting healthier sleep patterns in this more educated group. Income was positively associated with sleep duration. Nearly 29.2% of short sleepers reported incomes below $25,000 compared to 15.4% among those with 68 hours of sleep. High-income earners (> $100,000) were most concentrated among recommended sleepers (37.1%) and least common among short sleepers (20.7%). Compared to their baseline proportionsmarried (47.2%), previously married (30.8%), and never married (22.0%) previously married individuals were overrepresented among short sleepers (38.2%) but underrepresented among those with recommended sleep (27.8%). Married individuals were slightly overrepresented in the 68 hour sleep group (49.9%), suggesting more optimal sleep patterns in this group. After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, subtle shifts in sleep patterns were observed. Compared to their overall representation (48.5%), post-COVID respondents were slightly overrepresented in the recommended sleep group (49.2%) but underrepresented among short sleepers (46.5%) and long sleepers (48.0%). These differences, however, were mar ginal at best. Mental and physical health outcomes varied by sleep duration.

Similarly, physically unhealthy days followed the same pattern, with short sleepers reporting the highest mean (16.4  11.5), followed by long sleepers (15.3  11.5), and recommended sleepers (10.7  10.6) (p < 0.001). General health status differed by sleep duration (Table 1). Adults reporting recommended sleep had the most favor able profiles, with higher predicted probabilities of excellent (0.077) and very good health (0.258) than those with short (0.049 and 0.197, respectively) or long sleep (0.033 and 0.151, respectively). In contrast, the predicted probabilities of fair and poor health were lowest among those with recommended sleep (0.231 and 0.100) and highest among long sleep ers (0.313 and 0.203). These patterns indicate that both short and long sleep durations are associated with worse self- reported health compared with recommended sleep (Table 1). Sensitivity analyses Re-analysis using revised sleep-duration categories (6 hours, 79 hours,  10 hours) yielded results consistent with the primary findings (S1 File).

As shown in Table 2, the prevalence of short sleep duration (5 hours per night) modestly declined from 21.5% in 2016 (95% CI: 20.922.1%) to 19.8% in 2020 (95% CI: 19.020.5%), before increasing slightly to 20.5% in 2022 (95% CI: 19.921.1%). In contrast, the proportion of adults reporting recommended sleep duration (68 hours) gradually increased across survey waves, rising from 69.5% in 2016 to 71.0% in 2022. Meanwhile, long sleep duration (9 hours) remained relatively stable, ranging between 8.5% and 10.0% across the same period. These patterns suggest a modest but con sistent shift toward healthier sleep durations over time, providing further context for interpreting the health associations reported in this study (S1 Fig 1 in S1 File).

These results highlight a clear inverse relationship between sleep duration and mental health burden. Both insufficient (5 hours) and excessive (9 hours) sleep durations are associated with an increased number of poor mental health days, reinforcing the mental health benefits of maintaining a recommended sleep schedule.

Err. = 0.041, z = 77.02, p < 0.001; 95% CI: 3.1133.276). Individuals in the recommended sleep group reported an average of 10.723 physically unhealthy days per month (Std.

A similar pattern was observed for reports of very good health, which were most common among individuals with recom mended sleep (0.258; 95% CI, 0.2540.261), declining among those with short sleep (0.197; 95% CI, 0.1940.201) and long sleep (0.151; 95% CI, 0.1430.158). In contrast, the probability of reporting fair or poor health increased notably with departure from recommended sleep duration.

Collectively, these findings indicate a graded, U-shaped association, wherein both short and long sleep are associated with less favorable self-rated general health compared with recom mended sleep duration. Discussion In this large, nationally representative sample of over 300,000 U.S. adults, we observed significant associations between sleep duration and key health outcomes, including depression, poor mental health days, poor physical health days, and self-rated general health. Using IPW to adjust for confounding, we found that both short sleep (5 hours) and long sleep (9 hours) were independently associated with worse health outcomes compared to individuals who reported recom mended sleep duration (68 hours). Our findings reinforce previous literature that short sleep duration is a strong predictor of adverse mental and physical health outcomes [21,4547]. Adults reporting 5 hours of sleep had significantly higher incidence of depression (+14.1%, 95% CI: 13.8%14.4%), longer duration of poor mental health (5.3 days), and poor physical health (4.4 days) in the past month. Furthermore, 44.8% of short sleepers rated their general health as fair or poor. These outcomes are in line with existing evi dence that sleep deprivation can dysregulate emotional [48,49], cognitive [48,50], and immune [48,51,52] functioning. Interestingly, and consistent with emerging literature [53,54], we also found that long sleep duration (9 hours) was associated with higher burden of depression and poorer general health compared to the reference group. Though tradi tionally underexplored, prolonged sleep has increasingly been implicated in poor health outcomes, potentially reflecting underlying undiagnosed health conditions or behavioral and social determinants of health [5557]. For example, those in the  9-hour group had a 12.9% increase in depression incidence and reported worse mental and physical health than the 68-hour group, albeit with slightly lower burden than short sleepers.

Importantly, we accounted for the potential influence of the COVID-19 pandemic by including survey year and state fixed effects in our analysis. The pandemic period did not significantly modify the observed associations, suggesting that the link between sleep duration and health outcomes persisted regardless of broader societal disruptions.

A recent analysis by Udupa et al. (2023) reported an increase in the burden of poor mental health days among U.S. adults, with notable disparities by sex, age, and income [59]. Our study corroborates these trends and extends the evidence by linking these poor mental health days directly to sleep duration [60], further supporting calls for prioritizing sleep health in population-level interventions. The inclusion of general health as an outcome in this study strengthens its contribution to literature [6163]. The strong association between suboptimal sleep and self-rated poor general health reflects sleeps critical role in broader wellness perceptions and functional status. These findings emphasize that interventions targeting sleep hygiene may not only miti gate psychiatric and physical morbidity but also improve perceived quality of life. Public health implications Our findings carry substantial public health and policy implications, underscoring the critical role of optimal sleep duration, neither too short nor too long, in promoting mental, physical, and general health. The results reveal a U-shaped association where both short sleep (5 hours) and long sleep (9 hours) are linked with increased incidence of depression, more mentally and physically unhealthy days, and worse self-rated general health. This suggests that public health messaging should shift from simply promoting more sleep to advocating for an opti mal range, particularly 68 hours, as supported by organizations such as the CDC and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

This suggests that public health messaging should shift from simply promoting more sleep to advocating for an opti mal range, particularly 68 hours, as supported by organizations such as the CDC and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Given the high prevalence of short sleep in the U.S., especially among working adults and socioeconomically disad vantaged populations, routine screening for sleep patterns should be integrated into primary care and behavioral health visits. In addition, the growing body of evidence, reinforced by our findings, points to a need to assess for long sleep as a potential marker of underlying health risk, rather than dismissing it as benign. Policy interventions could include public education campaigns promoting the 68-hour sleep guideline, employer-based initiatives that encourage healthy worklife balance and limit excessive shift work, and insurance coverage for evidence-based sleep interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Technology-assisted tools such as sleep tracking apps and behavioral nudges via telehealth may help scale these efforts. Finally, our findings are consistent with national estimates, including data from Udupa et al. (2023), showing an increase in poor mental health days among U.S. adults. Addressing sleep as a modifiable behavioral target could be a scalable and cost-effective strategy to help reverse these mental health trends, particularly when tailored to high-risk subgroups. Strengths and limitations This study possesses several methodological strengths that enhance its validity, robustness, and generalizability. Lever aging a large, nationally representative sample from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), our findings are applicable to diverse adult populations across the United States. The categorization of sleep duration into three distinct groups (short:  5 hours, recommended: 68 hours, and long:  9 hours) enabled a nuanced assessment of sleep-health relationships beyond the conventional binary classification. Importantly, the application of IPW allowed for adjustment of key sociodemographic and behavioral confounders and strengthened the causal interpretation of the aver age treatment effects of sleep duration on depression, self-rated general health, and mentally and physically unhealthy days.

We also accounted for state and survey year fixed effects, including adjustment for the COVID-19 period, ensuring temporal and regional influences were considered. Nevertheless, several limitations warrant consideration. First, sleep duration was self-reported, introducing the possibil ity of recall bias or misclassification. Recent evidence suggests that a proportion of individuals who self-report long sleep PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321347 January 14, 2026 15 / 18 may actually obtain insufficient sleep when measured objectively, indicating potential misclassification among long sleep ers and the need for cautious interpretation of this category. Objective sleep assessments, such as actigraphy or polysom nography, would yield more precise measures but were unavailable in this dataset. Second, the cross-sectional design limits causal inference and cannot fully address the bidirectionality between sleep and health outcomes. For instance, while short or long sleep durations may increase the risk of depression or poorer physical health, these conditions may also disrupt sleep patterns, leading to cyclical feedback loops. Third, while we adjusted for a broad array of covariates, residual confounding by unmeasured variables, such as undiagnosed sleep disorders, chronic stress, or genetic predispo sitions, cannot be entirely ruled out. Lastly, the BRFSS sleep module was administered only in selected years, potentially affecting temporal trend analysis despite our efforts to stratify by survey year. Future research should employ longitudinal and experimental designs to clarify causality and explore potential biologi cal and behavioral mechanisms underlying the associations observed. Such work may also identify vulnerable subpopula tions who would benefit most from targeted sleep health interventions.

These findings reinforce the importance of maintaining optimal sleep duration as a key determinant of population mental and physical well-being. Public health efforts should prioritize strategies to promote sleep health, identify at-risk individuals, and address underlying factors contributing to inadequate or excessive sleep. Tailored interventions, health education campaigns, and clinical screening for sleep patterns may collectively improve individual outcomes and reduce the burden of sleep-related health disparities across the United States.

Regression models were used to estimate cross-sectional relationships between inflammation (IL-6, CRP, fibrinogen, e-selectin, sICAM-1, albumin, and WBC) and a modified Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), index subcomponents, and self-reported sleep duration. Change in inflammatory markers between 2000 and 2006 was also used to predict long or short sleep duration in 2006. ResultsInflammation was not related to the overall index of sleep quality. However, longer sleep (> 8 hours) was associated with higher levels of inflammation. These associations remained after adjustment for waist circumference, self-reported health decline, diabetes, arthritis/ rheumatism, heart disease, and depressive symptoms. Increases in inflammation between 2000 and 2006 were associated with long but not short sleep duration in 2006 for several markers.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript Introduction Experimental and observational data indicate that sleep duration and other sleep characteristics are associated with a wide array of health outcomes including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity (1-3). Recent work has begun to investigate the role of inflammation in mediating associations between sleep and health outcomes (4-7). Experimentally, sleep deprivation is associated with acute elevation of both C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)(8, 9), but findings in non-experimental settings have been mixed (5-7, 10-12). Associations between overall sleep quality and inflammatory markers have been more consistent but have still produced diverse findings (13). This paper examined associations between self-reported sleep duration, sleep quality and biomarkers of inflammation in a middle-aged and elderly cohort of Taiwanese adults. Biologically, there are plausible mechanisms linking inflammation and sleep in both causal directions (14).

This paper examined associations between self-reported sleep duration, sleep quality and biomarkers of inflammation in a middle-aged and elderly cohort of Taiwanese adults. Biologically, there are plausible mechanisms linking inflammation and sleep in both causal directions (14). Activation of the autonomic nervous system and elevated catecholamines during sleep deprivation can stimulate production of inflammatory mediators (10). Sleep deprivation also leads to blood pressure elevations that may increase endothelial shear stress (the force of flowing blood over the surface of the endothelium) (15), resulting in endothelial production of inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and adhesion molecules such as e-selectin and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) (10, 16). In the reverse direction, cytokines may have direct effects on the brain, including the regions involved in sleep regulation (14, 17). Cytokines are important regulators of host defense to infection, and the sleep-inducing impact of cytokines such as IL-6, as well as other immune cells that increase expression of these cytokines, may predispose persons with elevated levels of inflammation to longer sleep durations (18). This study seeks to fill several gaps in the current literature. First, while studies of sleep duration and outcomes such as obesity, diabetes, and mortality have focused on the U- shaped risk of both short and long sleep, studies on sleep duration and inflammation have focused either on short sleep duration or modeled sleep duration linearly, both approaches potentially missing an effect at longer durations. Second, the majority of existing studies of sleep characteristics and inflammation have examined Western populations. A biological necessity, sleep is also a complex behavior influenced by cultural and social factors, such as the encouragement or discouragement of naps, traditional care giving roles, or the amount of time typically devoted to work. Thus, cross-cultural studies may help elucidate disease etiology in settings where the determinants of sleep habits differ (19). Lastly, most studies on sleep characteristics and inflammation have looked at young adult populations, but differences in these relationships may emerge in older populations, among whom chronic disease and higher levels of inflammation are more prevalent (20,", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 3555, "end_char": 6246}, {"chunk_id": "dowd2011sleep_chunk_004", "source_id": "dowd2011sleep", "text": ".

Lastly, most studies on sleep characteristics and inflammation have looked at young adult populations, but differences in these relationships may emerge in older populations, among whom chronic disease and higher levels of inflammation are more prevalent (20, 21). It is possible that the mechanisms through which sleep affects inflammatory processes (and vice versa) vary across the life span. In particular, long sleep is most prevalent in those over age 60, and a lengthening of sleep duration may coincide with the aging process and declining health (22-24). Methods Sample Data are from the 2000 and 2006 Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS) of Taiwanese adults ages 53 and over in 2006. All participants were part of the ongoing Taiwan Longitudinal Study of Aging (TLSA) initiated in 1989, with interviews conducted every 3-4 years and with periodic inclusion of younger refresher cohorts (25). In 2000, a demographic and health update, blood and urine specimens, and a medical examination were collected on a subset of respondents (SEBAS I, see (26) for a description). Dowd et al.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript Six years later, a follow-up (SEBAS II) was conducted with those who completed the 2000 exam and survived to 2006 as well as with a sample of respondents aged 53 to 60 who were first interviewed in the 2003 wave of TLSA. Written informed consent was obtained for participation in both the in-home interview and hospital visit in 2000 and 2006; all SEBAS protocols were approved by human subjects committees in Taiwan, and at Georgetown and Princeton Universities.

Sixty-eight percent of those interviewed in SEBAS I and 81 percent in SEBAS II agreed to participate in the physical examination. Previous analysis suggests that estimates from the SEBAS exams are unlikely to be seriously biased by non-participation in the presence of controls for age (27-29). The physical examination followed a similar protocol in both waves. Several weeks after the household interview, participants collected a 12-hour overnight urine sample (7pm to 7am), fasted overnight, and visited a nearby hospital the following morning for an examination that included collection of a blood specimen and measurements of blood pressure and anthropometry. Compliance in the collection of the blood and 12-hour urine samples was high: 96 percent in 2000 and 88 percent in 2006 fasted overnight and provided a suitable urine specimen. Blood and urine specimens were analyzed at Union Clinical Laboratories in Taipei. This paper used data from 639 survivors of SEBAS I who participated in the SEBAS II examination plus 397 persons aged 53-60 who were first interviewed in 2003. Sixteen observations were dropped for missing data on one or more covariates, leaving a total of 1020 respondents. Measures Sleep Sleep questions were asked for the first time in 2006. A shortened version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) captured five dimensions of sleep over the month prior to interview (30): subjective sleep quality, sleep latency (time to fall asleep), sleep duration (during the night), sleep efficiency (hrs asleep/hrs in bed), and sleep dysfunction (daytime sleepiness).1 As with the full-length PSQI, each dimension was scored on a 0-3 scale, with higher numbers reflecting worse sleep quality. The overall (shortened) PSQI was a sum of the five subcomponents, with a range of (0-15). In accordance with the traditional PSQI scale, sleep duration was coded categorically (0=7 hours, 1=6 to <7 hours, 2=5 to <6 hours, and 3=<5 hours).

In accordance with the traditional PSQI scale, sleep duration was coded categorically (0=7 hours, 1=6 to <7 hours, 2=5 to <6 hours, and 3=<5 hours). Because of potential associations between both long and short sleep duration and health outcomes, we also categorized sleep duration as <6 hours, 6-8 hours, and >8 hours for separate non-linear analyses. Inflammatory markers Inflammatory markers were assayed from overnight fasting serum samples. We examined all inflammation-related markers measured in SEBAS I and II: C-Reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), white blood cell count (WBC), fibrinogen (SEBAS II only), albumin, e- selectin, and sICAM-1; measures of IL-6, e-selectin, sICAM-1, and CRP for SEBAS I were derived from frozen specimens collected in 2000 and assayed between 2007 and 2009. CRP, an acute phase protein, is an important component of the non-specific innate immune system response to infection and injury and is often used as a general marker of systemic inflammation (32, 33). IL-6 is the primary inflammatory cytokine responsible for upregulation of CRP (34). Fibrinogen is an acute phase protein that plays an important role 1The original PSQI contains two additional subcomponents: sleep disturbances and use of sleep medication (30). Subsequent research has shown that the sleep medication component is not significantly associated with the global PSQI score, and sleep disturbances had a low correlation with the global score (31).

Albumin is involved in the transport of small molecules in the blood and in the maintenance of osmotic pressure, with low levels associated with inflammation (35). E-selectin and sICAM-1 are adhesion molecules that mediate the attachment of monocytes and lymphocytes to endothelial cells (36, 37). Levels of soluble adhesion molecules reflect the process of inflammation of vessel walls. White blood cells (leukocytes) are infection fighting blood cells that are also used as a measure of systemic inflammation (38). Serum albumin was assayed using the bromcresol green method (DL=1.0 g/dL, CV=1.5 percent). Leukocyte (WBC) count was determined by direct current (DL=0.02103/L, CV=1.5 percent). Fibrinogen was measured using the coagulation method. E-selectin and sICAM-1 were each assayed using ELISA (R&D Systems, Quantikine kit). CRP samples were measured with a high sensitivity immunoturbidimetry assay (Bayer ADVIA1800 for 2000 samples and Roche Cobas Integra 800-CRPLX for 2006 samples; DL=0.012mg/dL 2000 samples and 0.071 mg/dL 2006 samples). IL-6 was measured using ELISA; (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, DL=0.7 pg/mL; CV=12.1 percent). Inflammatory markers were treated as continuous variables, with natural log transformations for skewed distributions where appropriate (CRP, IL-6, sICAM-1 and e-selectin). For CRP, the only marker with established clinical cut-offs, we also constructed two dichotomous measures: > 3.0mg/L, the cut-off for increased cardiovascular disease risk; and >10.0mg/L, the cut-off for evidence of current or recent infection (39). From the 2006 markers, we", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 10753, "end_char": 12772}, {"chunk_id": "dowd2011sleep_chunk_008", "source_id": "dowd2011sleep", "text": " Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, DL=0.7 pg/mL; CV=12.1 percent).

From the 2006 markers, we created an inflammation index (0-7) that counted the number of markers for which an individual was in the highest risk quartile. From this index we also created an indicator for high inflammation based on whether the individual was in the top quartile of risk for 3 or more markers (27% of the sample). In an effort to eliminate persons experiencing acute infection rather than chronic inflammation, all models (excepting those with CRP>10mg/L as a predictor) were rerun excluding individuals with WBC count >10 103/L (3.2%) and separately CRP >10mg/L (17.7%), with similar substantive results (available upon request). We adjusted for the following potentially inflammation-related health conditions in 2006: measured waist circumference, self-reported health decline (worse health than one year ago), diabetes, arthritis/rheumatism, heart disease, and depressive symptoms. Diabetes, arthritis/ rheumatism and heart disease were based on the question has a doctor ever told you that you have the condition. Depressive symptoms were measured using a 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) questionnaire, excluding the one question pertaining to sleep quality. Shortened versions of the traditional 20 question CES-D have shown reliability in Western as well as Chinese populations (40, 41), and this subset has been found to predict mortality in the broader TLSA (42). Statistical Analysis First, we estimated linear regression models with each inflammatory marker as an outcome to examine cross-sectional associations between individual markers and the overall modified PSQI as well as the five PSQI sleep components, adjusted for age and sex.

Linear probability regression models were run for the dichotomous CRP variables, the overall inflammation index, and the dichotomous indicator of high overall inflammation (results using logit models for binary outcomes were very similar). Next, we ran analogous models for each inflammatory marker using a categorical measure of sleep duration (<6 hours, 6-8 hours, >8 hours) as the predictor, with and without adjustment for potential health mediators. Finally, because of the possibility that inflammation can promote sleep (18), we tested whether increases in inflammation between Dowd et al. Page 4 Ann Epidemiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 November 1. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript 2000 and 2006 predicted sleep duration in 2006. This analysis included all markers except fibrinogen (which was collected only in 2006), and was based on respondents who participated in both waves (n=639). For each biomarker, we used a multinomial logit model with sleep duration coded categorically as the dependent variable, adjusted for age, sex and baseline inflammation levels. Because some studies have found sex differences in relationships between inflammation and sleep (13, 43), we also tested for interactions by sex; these interactions were not statistically significant and thus were not included in our final models. Results The average age of the sample was 66 years, with 6.4 average hours of reported sleep (Table 1). Overall, there were few associations between the inflammatory markers and the PSQI subcomponents or the overall PSQI (Table 2). There were no significant associations for CRP, IL-6, fibrinogen, WBC, or albumin. sICAM-1 showed marginally significant positive associations with the overall index (p0.057), sleep efficiency (p0.092), and a significant association with the index measure of short sleep duration (p.012).

Self-reported sleep quality was also positively associated with e-selectin (p.041). In all of these cases, the direction of effect suggested that poorer sleep quality was associated with higher levels of these markers. There were no associations between any of the PSQI subcomponents and the overall inflammation index. Compared with respondents who reported 6-8 hours of sleep, respondents reporting long sleep had significantly (p<.05) higher levels of CRP, IL-6, fibrinogen, WBC, and lower (worse) levels of albumin in age and sex adjusted models (crude models in Table 3). They were also more likely to have CRP levels above the clinical cut-offs for both cardiovascular disease and acute infection, and to score higher on the overall inflammation index. For respondents reporting short sleep (<6 hours), a significant relationship was found only with higher levels of sICAM-1. Adjustment for potential mediators had a modest effect on these associations. Figure 1 illustrates the significant associations between inflammatory markers and sleep duration in 2006 based on the crude models from Table 3 (for ease of interpretation, logged outcomes have been exponentiated to show the magnitude of absolute effects). In the presence of controls for baseline levels, increases in IL-6 and s-ICAM-1 and decreases (worsening) in albumin between 2000 and 2006 were associated with a higher risk of long but not short sleep duration in 2006 (Table 4).

Discussion From our cross-sectional data, we found virtually no relationship between biomarkers of inflammation and the overall sleep quality index or its subcomponents. In contrast, we found a strong relationship between long sleep duration and most markers of inflammation, with little evidence of associations between short sleep duration and inflammation. Increases in inflammation between 2000 and 2006, determined from longitudinal data, were associated with an increased relative risk of long sleep duration in 2006, with no association found for Dowd et al. Page 5 Ann Epidemiol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 November 1. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript short sleep duration. This result may support the hypothesis that high inflammation is related to long sleep duration via the worsening of co-morbidities associated with inflammation. This work is consistent with some, but not all, previous research on inflammation and sleep. For example, Okun et al. (2009) found that poor sleep quality as measured by the PSQI was associated with higher CRP but not with IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) in a sample of 43 young U.S. women, with no associations between inflammatory markers and sleep duration as measured continuously, consistent with our primarily negative findings for sleep quality and continuous sleep duration(5). Friedman et al. (2005) identified relationships between IL-6 and the PSQI global score at the bivariate level but not after adjustment for sociodemographic factors in a sample of 74 U.S. women aged 61-90 (7). Better sleep efficiency, as measured by the in-home NightCap monitoring system, was related to significantly lower levels of IL-6 in this sample. McDade et al.

Two studies have found associations between self-reported sleep and inflammation for women but not men, in contrast to our findings of no interactions by sex. Miller et al. (2009) recently found lower IL-6 in women sleeping 8 compared to 7 hours and higher CRP for women sleeping 5 hours or less compared to 7 hours, but no associations for men in the Whitehall II sample of 4600 individuals (43). Using the PSQI, Suarez (2008) found that overall sleep quality and difficulty falling asleep were associated with higher fibrinogen, IL-6, and CRP only for women in a sample of 210 young adults in North Carolina (13). These differences may reflect different associations between sex, psychosocial factors, and sleep disturbance in American and British compared with Taiwanese women, or differences in these relationships at younger compared with older ages. Only one previous study to our knowledge has found associations between longer sleep duration and increased levels of inflammatory markers. Patel et al (2009) found that additional hours of self-reported sleep were associated with higher levels of CRP and IL-6, while short duration during observed polysomnography was associated with higher levels of TNF- in a sample of 614 adults from the Cleveland Family Study (6). In the only study of sleep quality and inflammation in a non-Western population, no associations between self- reported sleep quality and IL-6 and CRP were found for Chinese adults aged 50-70 (44), consistent with our findings.

Many studies have found associations between long sleep and mortality, even adjusting for multiple chronic conditions (45). Recent work from the U.S. found that this relationship held for the elderly but not middle-aged adults; the authors concluded that the association between long-sleep and mortality is a consequence of underlying medical conditions and age-related sleep changes (46). The current study suggests that inflammation may be a mediator of the relationship between underlying health, long sleep, and mortality. In individuals with sleep disorders, circulating levels of IL-6 predict severity of daytime sleepiness, and experiments have shown that administration of IL-6 leads to somnolence (47). Sleep is also known to dramatically increase during the last few weeks or months of life, and sleep-inducing effects of cytokines may contribute to this phenomenon (23). While less supported, it is also possible that long sleep directly causes inflammation. Long sleep has been associated with increased sleep fragmentation and more frequent awakenings, which can influence cytokine expression (22). Our study is limited by a one-time measure of sleep characteristics. Because our analyses are primarily cross-sectional, no causal relationship between increased levels of inflammatory Dowd et al.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript markers and longer sleep duration can be established. While the association between long sleep and inflammation was not mediated by measures of chronic conditions in our sample, it is possible that unmeasured disease processes with an inflammatory component are a source of both inflammation and long sleep duration. This explanation would be consistent with our findings that increases in inflammation between waves predicted long sleep duration in the second wave, and broader findings in the literature of an association between long sleep and mortality.

Our study contributes to the sparse literature on long sleep duration and inflammation, which may be particularly salient for older populations. The current study's strengths include a large sample size compared with previous studies, an extensive array of inflammatory markersincluding measures of change for most markers-- and one of the first investigations of these associations in a non-Western sample. Afternoon naps are customary among the elderly in Taiwan, with some evidence suggesting that nappers have better nocturnal sleep quality(49). Since the PSQI asks only about nighttime sleep duration, it is possible that total sleep duration is longer than reported, making short nighttime sleep duration less detrimental and longer nighttime sleep duration a stronger indicator of poor health. Future work on sleep duration and inflammation should move beyond an exclusive focus on short sleep and examine the potential importance of long sleep as a marker of underlying inflammatory illness. Prospective studies of sleep and inflammatory markers can help shed light on whether these relationships are causal or are driven by other factors. Such studies could also help elucidate the role of inflammation in the observed association between long sleep and mortality, contributing to our understanding of sleep as both a cause and consequence of ill health.

One of the factors influencing this effect could be physical activity (PA). The study aimed to assess the impact of deprivation of sleep (DS) on selected inflammatory parameters. Seventy-seven participants completed the protocol consisting of polysomnography (PSG) conducted in a sleep laboratory and DS, monitored with an actigraph. PA was assessed with actigraphy, which categorized participants as active or inactive. White blood cells (WBC) values negatively correlated with sleep efficiency based on sleep diaries and PSG parameters (total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and REM duration), but regression analysis showed that WBC depends only on the sleep diary parameter. Granulocytes (GRA) positively correlated with REM latency, and negatively with sleep efficiency. After DS, all participants exhibited an elevated GRA count. The number of WBC and GRA increased also in the active group; inactive participants showed no changes in inflammatory parameters. The overall number of WBC depends primarily on the quality of sleep over a period of several days. Under the influence of sleep deprivation, the number of GRA increases, but the number of leukocytes depends on the level of physical activity during DS. Keywords Sleep deprivation, Inflammation, C-reactive protein Sleep disorders are a common problem in the general population. It is estimated they affect about 30% of the population1. Deprivation of sleep (DS) is defined as a forced lack of sleep, which might stem from a number of causes, including work, leisure or pain2. Insufficient sleep duration can lead to several systemic complications, including impairment of immunity. In a murine DS model, elevated levels of autoantibodies were observed, which are characteristic of many autoim- mune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus3. Hsiao et al. in their study showed that individuals with sleep disorders have a higher risk of developing the following immune-mediated diseases: systemic lupus ery- thematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spond", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 0, "end_char": 2426}, {"chunk_id": "sochal2024effect_chunk_002", "source_id": "sochal2024effect", "text": " is defined as a forced lack of sleep, which might stem from a number of causes, including work, leisure or pain2.

Hsiao et al. in their study showed that individuals with sleep disorders have a higher risk of developing the following immune-mediated diseases: systemic lupus ery- thematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and Sjgrens syndrome, with hazard ratios between 1.45 and 1.81, compared to those without sleep issues4. One study showed that long-term DS affects changes in the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6, but not in the number of white blood cells (WBC)5. The pathophysiology of the described effects is not fully understood. Most of them are based on animal models. Up to date only a few studies compared inflammatory parameters after a night of sleep and DS in the same participants, and the study groups were often small6,7. In one study, 9 participants were deprived of sleep, and their results were compared to those of 8 other participants who had a full nights sleep. The WBC count increased after sleep deprivation, but there was no change in the WBC count after a nights sleep7. Many factors can affect inflammatory parameters, such as chronic diseases, body mass, sex, and physical activ- ity (PA). It seems that additional factors, such as activity during DS, may underlie the differences in human model studies. One study showed that acute exercise can reduce the production of tumor necrosis factor. It seems that the reduced inflammatory response during intense exercise can protect against low-grade chronic inflammation8. However, the effect of physical activity during DS on inflammatory parameters was not investigated. Therefore, the aim of the study was to estimate the effect of sleep duration, quality as well as both acute and chronic sleep deprivation on selected inflammatory factors, while taking into account actigraphic data obtained during DS.

In total, the results of 77 participants were analyzed. The participant characteristics are presented in Table 1. Average sleep efficiency based on sleep diaries was negatively correlated with morning WBC and lymphocytes (LYM) values, but not with granulocytes (GRA), monocytes (MON) values, or CRP concentration (Table 2). Additionally, sleep time and sleep latency did not correlate with any of the inflammatory parameters (P > 0.05, Table 2). After a night of sleep (PSG examination), morning WBC values negatively correlated with total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency, REM duration, but not with NREM duration. LYM and MON values did not correlate with PSG parameters (P > 0.05, Table 2). GRA positively correlated with REM latency, negatively with sleep efficiency and REM duration. CRP concentrations negatively correlated only with sleep latency, but not with other PSG parameters (Table 2). Regression analysis showed that WBC values were affected by sleep efficiency calculated on the basis of sleep diaries (B =  0.04, t =  2.92, P = 0.005), but not by PSG parameters (REM durations, number of REM events, sleep efficiency; R2 = 0.10, F = 8.55, P = 0.005).

Following DS, the GRA value increased compared to the value observed after a night of sleep (3.1 IQR: 2.63.9 vs. 3.5 IQR: 2.74.2 *10^3/l, P = 0.002). Other inflammatory parameters remained unchanged (Table 3). Among participants classified as inactive, inflammatory parameters did not change (P > 0.05, Table 3.). In the active group, both WBC and GRA counts increased (WBC: 5.3 IQR: 4.95.7 vs. 5.6 IQR: 5.17.5 *10^3/l, P = 0.015; GRA: 2.9 IQR: 2.63.2 vs. 3.5 IQR: 2.74.6 *10^3/l, P = 0.003), whereas MON values and CRP concentrations remained unchanged (Table 3). After DS, inflammatory parameters did not correlate with the physical activity index during the entire night, apart from a negative correlation with the change in CRP concentration. The intensity of physical activity during the last two hours also did not correlate with inflammatory parameters. However, the activity during the last hour of DS positively correlated with WBC and GRA. The change in WBC values between a night of sleep and after DS negatively correlated with physical activity during the last hour of DS (Table 2).

However, studies on this topic are often inconclusive because they involve different sleep disorders. The difficulties arise also due to the diversity of the adopted models of insomnia and DS. Other causes of insufficient or ineffective sleep are often not taken into account. In addition, comparisons are frequently made at different points in time, disregarding the circadian rhythm. In the first stage of this study, the association of selected inflammatory parameters with sleep quality was assessed for 2 weeks using sleep diaries. It was observed that the concentration of WBC and LYM negatively correlated with sleep efficiency. No correlation of inflammatory parameters with sleep duration or sleep latency was observed. A Korean study of 136 participants found that poor sleep quality is associated with increased WBC count9. Another study found that shift workers with higher scores on the Athens Insomnia Scale also had a higher WBC count. The study also found that the association between insomnia symptoms and WBC was stronger in shift workers than in day workers10. This study also showed a relationship between sleep efficiency and the level of granulocytes. Nie et al. did not observe any differences in their levels. Similarly, another study did not show any significant differences in the levels of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets, CD8 + T and CD56 + lymphocytes, platelet-to- lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, complement C3, complement C4, IgM, IgA, and interleukin-6 Table 2.

However, the diagnosis of insomnia was based solely on clinical criteria, and PSG was not performed to rule out other causes of insufficient sleep. In the following step, the relationship between inflammatory markers and sleep quality was examined, as determined by the outcomes of a one-night PSG study. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no stud- ies that have chosen more objective parameters for the assessment of the link between symptoms of insomnia and inflammation. Negative correlations were observed between WBC and total sleep time and sleep efficiency. However, regression analysis showed that WBC levels mainly depend on sleep efficiency, which is the average of 2-week measurements, and not on a single night. These results confirm the above-mentioned association of WBC with chronic insomnia9. In this study, CRP was negatively correlated only with sleep latency. The results were unexpected, as the available literature showed no association between CRP and sleep quality parameters. For example, a negative correlation was shown between CRP concentration and sleep duration12. In a large study, it was observed that men who slept 10 h or more per day had elevated levels of CRP13. In women, difficulty falling and staying asleep were associated with elevated CRP levels, however, sleep duration was self-reported thus prone to bias13. The average CRP level in women who woke up early in the morning was 72% higher than in women without such problems, while, contrary to this study, no association was observed between difficulty falling asleep and CRP levels14. The association between CRP and sleep restriction still requires further research. After DS, a significant increase in GRA levels was observed compared to the morning after a nights sleep but other parameters did not change. In a similar study on 15 healthy participants, an increase in GRA levels was observed under the influence of DS15. Similarly, Heiser et al. observed an increase in GRA after DS, and no differences were observed in WBC or LYM count16. However, in contrast to our study", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 13729, "end_char": 16076}, {"chunk_id": "sochal2024effect_chunk_014", "source_id": "sochal2024effect", "text": " higher than in women without such problems, while, contrary to this study, no association was observed between difficulty falling asleep and CRP levels14.

In a similar study on 15 healthy participants, an increase in GRA levels was observed under the influence of DS15. Similarly, Heiser et al. observed an increase in GRA after DS, and no differences were observed in WBC or LYM count16. However, in contrast to our study, among 23 volunteers, an increase in CRP levels was observed after DS compared to levels after a nights sleep assessed by actigraphy17. The abovementioned studies and available literature confirm an increase in GRA levels, while studies on other inflammatory parameters are inconsistent. An explanation for the observed differences may be physical activity during DS. After dividing the study participants into active and inactive during DS, the active group exhibited an increase in WBC, and GRA. On the other hand, in the inactive group none of the studied parameters changed. Notably, the greatest impact on WBC and GRA count in the morning was exerted by the activity in the last hour of actigraphy. According to our best knowledge, there are no similar studies. The available literature suggests an anti-inflammatory effect of physical activity, although this has only been studied during the daytime18. Therefore, any extrapolations should be made with caution. Additionally, a higher level of activity was observed in people whose mood did not change under the influence of DS19. It is difficult to definitively answer the question of the cause of the observed differences in the response of depressed participants to DS. Inflammation, one of the underlying causes of depression, could fulfill an important role also here20. However, this issue requires further research. Our study is one of the few that comprehensively examined the effects of sleep and a lack thereof on selected inflammatory parameters. However, this study has several limitations. Blood morphology as well as assessment of other inflammatory parameters was performed only in the morning after a nights sleep and DS, not in the evening, which limits the scope of the study.

Even though actigra- phy is a reliable method for controlling participant activity, it carries the risk of missing short naps and mistaking periods of inactivity with sleep. Observing patients during DS in a sleep laboratory with electroencephalography would probably yield the most objective results. The First night effect of the PSG is another important limita- tion of the present study, as it significantly skews sleep structure. In summary, we observed that the overall number of WBCs, including LYM, depends primarily on the quality of sleep over a period of several days. GRA correlates with objective sleep parameters, especially sleep latency and efficiency. Under the influence of sleep deprivation, the number of GRA increases, but the number of leukocytes depends on the level of physical activity during DS. Physical activity during DS may influence inflammatory parameters. This may explain the hitherto ambiguous literature on the impact of DS on inflammatory param- eters. In further studies, it would also be advisable to investigate the impact of longer sleep deprivation, as acute DS may not be sufficient to change some blood morphological elements. It is also necessary to search for other factors that affect the bodys response to sleep deprivation.

DS was conducted at least two weeks after the PSG; DS duration was set at ca.24 h, from one morning to the next. Enrolled subjects were permitted to spend the DS night in their place of residence. Physical activity was evaluated using actigraphy. Participants were provided with an actigraph (actigraph GENEActive Original, ActivInsights Ltd.) during their visit in the Department on the DS day. Actigraphy data were scored based on AASM guidelines23. Sedentary time was defined as a gravity-subtracted sum of vector magnitudes < 38624. Based on this calculation, subjects were divided into two groups: inactive (at least 70% of DS duration spent sedentary) and active (less than 30% of DS duration spent sedentary). Blood cell count was performed on venous blood collected in the morning after PSG as well as DS (10 PM and 7 AM ( 15 min)) in an EDTA tube using a Hematology Analyzer (Horiba ABX SAS,", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 21259, "end_char": 23516}, {"chunk_id": "sochal2024effect_chunk_018", "source_id": "sochal2024effect", "text": " the DS day.

Statistica 13.1 PL (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA) was used for data analysis. The significance level was set at p < 0.05. Assessment of distribution (normal/non-normal) for continuous variables was performed with the ShapiroWilk test. Data were presented as median with interquartile range or mean with standard deviation in case of non-normal and normal distribution, correspondingly. Parametric independent variables were assessed with a student t-test. MannWhitney U test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied for nonparametric inde- pendent or dependent variables, respectively. Spearmans correlation test was applied for correlations. Linear regression models were created by means of stepwise eliminationparameters were taken into account based on a sleep diary (sleep efficiency) and PSG examination (sleep efficiency, TST, NREM duration, REM duration).

Epidemiological evi- dence suggests that greater within-person consistency in sleep across nights relates to better health and performance [1], and irregularity in sleepwake patterns has emerged as a prominent risk factor for incident cardiometabolic diseases [24] and car- diovascular events [5]. However, few studies have assessed pro- spective associations of within-person consistency in sleepwake patterns, hereafter referred to as sleep regularity, with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Furthermore, no prior study has compared directly the robustness of mortality risk prediction of sleep regularity versus other important dimensions of sleep, such as sleep duration. In this issue of SLEEP, Windred et al. examined the role of sleep regularity in risk for mortality [6]. Using data from participants in the UK biobank who had completed 7 days of actigraphy during visits conducted between 2013 and 2016, the authors computed a sleep regularity index (SRI) score. Briefly, the SRI provides a gran- ular measure of concordance in patterns of sleep and wake states across days of recording, with higher scores indicative of greater interdaily consistency in sleepwake timing [6, 7]. Among the 60 997 middle-aged to elderly men and women with valid SRI data, 1859 deaths occurred between 2013 and 2021, equating to 4.84 deaths per 1000 person-years. The authors found that greater sleep regularity was associated with significantly lower risk for all-cause mortality. In fact,", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 0, "end_char": 2257}, {"chunk_id": "zuraikat2024consistency_chunk_002", "source_id": "zuraikat2024consistency", "text": " regularity index (SRI) score.

Among the 60 997 middle-aged to elderly men and women with valid SRI data, 1859 deaths occurred between 2013 and 2021, equating to 4.84 deaths per 1000 person-years. The authors found that greater sleep regularity was associated with significantly lower risk for all-cause mortality. In fact, relative to the lowest quintile of SRI, the highest quintile, representing those with the most stable interdaily sleepwake patterns, had 30% lower risk of mortality from all causes and 38% lower risk of cardiometabolic mortal- ity. Interestingly, while sleep duration was also found to predict mortality incidence, SRI produced larger minimum risk estimates for each mortality outcome aside from cardiometabolic deaths. This pattern was confirmed in models directly evaluating the predictive value of SRI versus sleep duration. Most notably, SRI produced a better fit for all-cause mortality data than did sleep duration [6]. Thus, this study not only found that sleep regularity was a significant predictor of all-cause and cause-specific mortal- ity but also suggests that consistency across nights in sleepwake timing may be more strongly related to mortality risk than sleep duration. Findings from Windred et al. [6] of an inverse relationship between sleep regularity and mortality risk have high public health relevance and support the need for this dimension of sleep to be considered in strategies for health promotion. For example, sleep duration has been formally recognized as a key determi- nant of cardiometabolic health [8], leading to its recent inclusion as one of the American Heart Associations Essential eight com- ponents of cardiovascular health [9]. The study from Windred et al. [6] adds to a growing body of evidence that regularity of nightly sleep is an independent correlate of future morbidity and mortal- ity that confers equal, if not greater, predictive value than sleep duration. While there is unequivocal evidence for a critical role of sleep duration in cardiometabolic health [8], irregular sleep, also a directly modifiable lifestyle behavior, is now strongly linked with both cardiometabolic costs [2] and mortality [6].

This high- lights the need to address multiple sleep behaviors to reap the greatest cardiometabolic health benefits. The study by Windred et al. also highlights areas for future research. As noted by the authors, there is a lack of diversity among UK Biobank participants, bringing into question the broader generalizability of findings. Therefore, it will be of par- ticular importance to replicate these findings among racially and ethnically diverse samples given established sleep health dispar- ities and their emerging contribution to broader health inequi- ties [10]. Another question stemming from this investigation is whether SRI is the most useful tool to capture interdaily regular- ity in sleep patterns. While the SRI provides a unique, valid, and reliable measure of sleep regularity that confers predictive value for health outcomes, the means of deriving this measure is com- plex and requires granular data on sleep and activity. In contrast, other measures of sleep variability, such as the intra-individual standard deviation (SD) of sleep onset timing, can be computed  The Author(s) 2023.

Interestingly, the SRI appears to correlate with such measures in this sample of UK Biobank participants, as higher SRI scores corresponded with lower SD of sleep onset timing [6]. More studies are needed to compare the various methods of quanti- fying sleep regularity and identify a simple metric that could be used in helping people keep their sleep schedule more constant. Maybe the most critical next step in this line of research will be to elucidate a causal pathway linking sleep regularity with health. In a landmark study of sleep regularity and cardiomet- abolic disease risk, Huang and Redline postulated that with- in-person deviations in the duration and/or timing of sleep likely represent the most prevalent cause of circadian disruptions at the population level [3]. That study catalyzed a surge of observa- tional research evaluating relationships between sleep regularity and a broad range of cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes in various population cohorts. In reviewing these studies, we found consistent evidence that greater irregularity in sleep was asso- ciated with poorer cardiometabolic outcomes; this relationship was observed across studies in different populations and using different methods of quantifying sleep regularity (e.g. SD of sleep onset timing, SRI, and social jetlag) [2, 11]. Despite evidence for a significant role of sleep regularity in health we also noted an absence of research designed to evaluate a causal impact of sleep regularity on health outcomes [2]. To the best of our knowledge, no study has directly assessed the causal impact on health outcomes of experimental changes in sleep regularity. Indirect evidence was provided by a secondary analysis of data from the control condition of a separate trial, whereby healthy women who reduced their bedtime SD (i.e. sta- bilized nightly sleep) over 6 weeks, while maintaining normal sleep duration of 79 hours/night, had reductions in adiposity and markers of endothelial cell dysfunction relative to those who did not stabilize their sleep [12]. However, the exploratory nature of that analysis in a small group of women precludes conclu- sions about causal effects of improving sleep regularity on health outcomes.

However, the exploratory nature of that analysis in a small group of women precludes conclu- sions about causal effects of improving sleep regularity on health outcomes. Thus, well-controlled randomized trials are needed to establish a causal relationship between sleep regularity and cardiovascular, endocrine, and metabolic outcomes and, impor- tantly, to elucidate the pathways linking sleep regularity with key biological, physiological, and behavioral outcomes known to impact longer-term health. Such studies would complement the important epidemiologic findings of the present study [6] and, together, will be key to optimizing sleep health recommendations and interventions to promote health and longevity.

Depression and anxiety are prevalent mental health disorders. While sleep duration has been extensively studied, sleep regularity may play a critical role. We aimed to examine associations between objectively measured sleep regularity and incident depression and anxiety and to investigate whether meeting recommended sleep duration modifies these associations. Methods. In 79,666 UK Biobank participants without baseline depression or anxiety, wrist accelerometers worn for 7 days yielded a sleep regularity index (SRI) and average sleep duration. SRI was categorized as irregular (51), moderately irregular (5270), or regular (71). Sleep duration was classified by age-specific recommendations (79 hours for ages 1864 years; 7 8 hours for over 65 years). Cox regression models assessed associations between sleep parameters and mental health outcomes. Results. During a median follow-up of 7.5 years, 1,646 participants developed depression, and 2,097 developed anxiety. Compared to irregular sleepers, regular sleepers had a 38% lower depression risk (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.520.73) and a 33% lower anxiety risk (HR, 0.67; 95%CI, 0.580.77). Participants with both irregular sleep and nonrecommended duration exhibited the highest risks (depression HR, 1.91; 95%CI, 1", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 0, "end_char": 2208}, {"chunk_id": "li2025regular_chunk_002", "source_id": "li2025regular", "text": " median follow-up of 7.5 years, 1,646 participants developed depression, and 2,097 developed anxiety.

Participants with both irregular sleep and nonrecommended duration exhibited the highest risks (depression HR, 1.91; 95%CI, 1.552.35; anxiety HR, 1.61; 95%CI, 1.351.93). Notably, irregular sleepers who met duration guidelines still faced elevated risks (depression HR, 1.48; 95%CI, 1.181.86; anxiety HR, 1.35; 95%CI, 1.11 1.64). Conclusions. Greater sleep regularity is independently associated with lower depression and anxiety risk regardless of sleep duration, suggesting that sleepwake consistency should be considered in mental health promotion strategies alongside traditional sleep duration recom- mendations. Introduction Mental health disorders, particularly depression and anxiety, represent a significant global health burden with increasing prevalence rates worldwide (COVID-19 Mental Disorders Collaborators, 2021). Depression affects approximately 280 million people globally, while anxiety disorders affect an estimated 301 million individuals, with both conditions often co-occurring and sharing common risk factors (GBD, 2019). Given their substantial societal impact, identifying modifiable risk factors for these disorders remains a public health priority. Sleep plays a fundamental role in maintaining mental health and emotional regulation. Extensive research has established robust associations between various sleep parameters and mental health outcomes (Scott et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2022). While numerous studies have focused on sleep duration, with both short and long sleep durations associated with adverse mental health outcomes (Chunnan, Shaomei, & Wannian, 2022), mounting evidence suggests that other dimensions of sleep may be equally important. Sleep regularity, the day-to-day consistency in sleepwake timing rather than the amount of sleep obtained, has emerged as a potentially critical component of healthy sleep (Windred et al., 2024).

Disruption of these rhythms, often manifested as irregular sleep patterns, may trigger cascading effects on neuroendocrine function, inflammatory processes, and neurotransmitter systems implicated in mood regulation (Logan & McClung, 2019; Walker, Walton, DeVries, & Nelson, 2020). Despite growing recognition of the importance of circadian rhythm, current research on sleep and mental health has several limitations. Studies have predominantly focused on sleep duration and quality, with insufficient attention to sleep regularity (Matric- ciani et al., 2018). Most existing studies rely on self-reported sleep measures, which are subject to recall bias and limited in capturing day-to-day variations in sleep patterns (Cespedes et al., 2016; Lauder- dale et al., 2008). Additionally, large-scale prospective studies using objective sleep measurements to examine the relationship between sleep regularity and incident depression oranxiety are notably scarce. Therefore, in this study, based on the UK Biobank database, we aimed to investigate the associations between objectively measured sleep regularity, sleep duration, and risk of developing depression and anxiety, and determine whether achieving recommended sleep duration mitigated the effects of irregular sleep on depression and anxiety incidence. Methods Study design The data used in this study were derived from the UK Biobank, a large, population-based prospective cohort study that included over 500,000 participants aged 3873 years, recruited between 2006 and 2010 (Allen et al., 2024). Participants completed an initial assess- ment at the time of recruitment, designed to capture information across a broad range of health and lifestyle factors, through ques- tionnaires and physical measurements (Sudlow et al., 2015). Between February 2013 and December 2015, a total of 103,683 participants with valid e-mail addresses from the UK Biobank", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 4977, "end_char": 7487}, {"chunk_id": "li2025regular_chunk_005", "source_id": "li2025regular", "text": " in this study were derived from the UK Biobank, a large, population-based prospective cohort study that included over 500,000 participants aged 3873 years, recruited between 2006 and 2010 (Allen et al., 2024).

Between February 2013 and December 2015, a total of 103,683 participants with valid e-mail addresses from the UK Biobank were randomly invited to participate in a 7-day wrist-worn accelerom- eter study. After excluding participants with depression or anxiety at baseline, a total of 89,533 participants were included. Further exclusion was conducted for participants with unreliable acceler- ometer data or missing data required for calculating the SRI and sleep duration. Ultimately, a total of 79,666 participants were included in the final analysis (Supplementary Figure 1). All participants gave written consent, and all data collection was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the North West Multicenter Research Ethics Com- mittee in the United Kingdom (Allen et al., 2024) and was con- ducted under UK Biobank application number 211772. Sleep regularity and sleep duration From this baseline cohort, participants wore Axivity AX3 devices (Axivity, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) on their dominant wrist for 7 days under free-living conditions. The Axivity AX3 accelerometer is a lightweight, wrist-worn device designed to capture triaxial accel- eration data continuously at a high resolution of 100 Hz, with a dynamic range of 8 gravity. The raw accelerometer data were preprocessed using the Euclidean Norm Minus One method, which removes the gravitational constant from the vector magnitude of the triaxial signals and expresses the resulting movement in milligravity units. Sleep status (awake or asleep) at any given time was estimated using the open-source R package GGIR, version 2.7-1, which lever- ages established algorithms (Vincent T. van Hees et al., 2015; Vincent Theodoor van Hees et al., 2018). In the absence of sleep diary data, GGIR uses a specific algorithm to define a daily sleep period time window for each participant (Vincent Theodoor van He", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 6921, "end_char": 9272}, {"chunk_id": "li2025regular_chunk_006", "source_id": "li2025regular", "text": " One method, which removes the gravitational constant from the vector magnitude of the triaxial signals and expresses the resulting movement in milligravity units. Sleep status (awake or asleep) at any given time was estimated using the open-source R package GGIR, version 2.7-1, which lever- ages established algorithms (Vincent T. van Hees et al., 2015; Vincent Theodoor van Hees et al., 2018). In the absence of sleep diary data, GGIR uses a specific algorithm to define a daily sleep period time window for each participant (Vincent Theodoor van Hees et al., 2018). This window represents the timeframe between the start and end of the main daily sleep episode, during which sustained inactivity, arm angle changes consistent with lying position, and the absence of intermittent movement patterns typical of conscious rest are interpreted as sleep. The validity of accelerometer-based sleep assessment has been established through comparison with polysom- nography. The GGIR algorithm shows 83% accuracy in sleepwake classification, with the specific Axivity AX3 device demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity for sleep detection (Doherty et al., 2017; van Hees et al., 2018). By default, the algorithm does not detect sleep episodes occurring outside this defined window and thus cannot identify naps. Sleep regularity was evaluated using the SRI, a metric that quantifies the consistency of daily sleep patterns by comparing consecutive days (Phillips et al., 2017). The SRI calculates the average concordance in sleepwake states across all time pairs separated by 24 hours. For example, two individuals may both achieve 8 hours of sleep, but one who consistently sleeps from 10 PM to 6 AM would have a high SRI score, while another who varies their sleep timing daily (e.g., 10 PM6 AM on Monday, 2 AM10 AM on Tuesday) would have a low SRI score despite similar sleep duration. Participants were included in the SRI calculation only if they had at least five valid days of accelerom- eter data, recorded for a minimum of 16 hours per day. This ensured that only high-quality data were used for downstream analyses. An SRI score of 100 indicates perfectly consistent sleep wake patterns, while a score of 0 reflects completely random patterns. Participants were categorized as irregular (025th per- centile, SRI 51); moderately irregular (2575th percentile, 52 SRI", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 8720, "end_char": 11096}, {"chunk_id": "li2025regular_chunk_007", "source_id": "li2025regular", "text": " AM on Monday, 2 AM10 AM on Tuesday) would have a low SRI score despite similar sleep duration.

Participants were categorized as irregular (025th per- centile, SRI 51); moderately irregular (2575th percentile, 52 SRI 70); and regular (75100th percentile, SRI 71) sleepers (Windred et al., 2021). Sleep duration data were extracted based on the same study days used for calculating the SRI. For each participant, the daily average sleep duration was calculated based on the period of sustained inactivity between sleep onset and offset times, as estimated by GGIR (Windred et al., 2024). The overall average sleep duration for each participant was then derived by aggregating these daily values across the study period. Participants were categorized based on whether they met the sleep duration recommendation of 79 hours per day for adults aged 1864 years or 78 hours per day for adults aged over 65 years (Hirshkowitz et al., 2015; Ross et al., 2020). Outcomes Depression and anxiety diagnoses were identified in participants through multiple sources, including hospital inpatient records, primary care, and death registry data. The primary care data captured information recorded by healthcare professionals in gen- eral practice settings, which typically identifies mental health con- ditions earlier than hospital admissions. The classification of depressive and anxiety disorders was based on the 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases, using diagnostic codes F32 (depressive episode) and F33 (recurrent depressive dis- order) for depression, and F40F48 (neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders) for anxiety, including all subcategories (Fan et al., 2025). Follow-up was conducted until depression or anxiety diagnosis, death, or the end of follow-up (October 31, 2022 for 2 Dong-Run Li et al. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291725101281 Published online by Cambridge University Press England, May 31, 2022 for Wales, and August 31,", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 10515, "end_char": 12849}, {"chunk_id": "li2025regular_chunk_008", "source_id": "li2025regular", "text": "depressive episode) and F33 (recurrent depressive dis- order) for depression, and F40F48 (neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders) for anxiety, including all subcategories (Fan et al., 2025).

Assessment of covariates Covariates included in the analysis were selected based on their potential confounding effects on the association between sleep regularity and health outcomes (Chaput et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2023). Baseline characteristics included age at recruitment (continuous, years), sex (male or female), body mass index (BMI, continuous), and ethnicity (White or non-White). Health- related covariates encompassed smoking status (never, previous, current, or unknown/missing); alcohol consumption status (never, previous, current, or unknown/missing); physical activity level (low: <600, moderate: 6003000, and high: >3000 metabolic equivalent tasks minutes/week); healthy diet score (continuous); and shift work (yes, no, or unknown/missing). The healthy diet score was calculated based on the consumption of fruits, veget- ables, processed meat, red meat, fish, whole grains, and refined grains (Supplementary Table 1). A score of 4 or above was considered indicative of a high diet quality. Socioeconomic fac- tors included household income (<31,000, 31,000, or unknown/missing); education level (college level, below college level, no qualification, or unknown/missing); and Townsend deprivation index (continuous). Additionally, the season during which the accelerometer was worn (spring, summer, autumn, or winter) was included as a covariate.

Statistical analysis Baseline characteristics of the participants were described as means (standard deviation) or medians (interquartile range) for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. In the statistical analysis, chi-square tests were used for cat- egorical variables. For continuous variables, a range of tests were applied, including analysis of variance, Wilcoxon tests, or KruskalWallis tests, depending on the data distribution and study requirements. Furthermore, we compared baseline char- acteristics between participants included and those excluded from the final analysis. Pearsons correlation coefficient was calculated to quantify the linear association between two sleep parameters. The proportionality assumption of Cox regression models was verified through Schoenfeld residuals analysis, confirming compli- ance with proportional hazards criteria across all variables (P > 0.05). Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between SRI and sleep duration with risks of depression and anxiety, with results reported as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). SRI was analyzed both as con- tinuous (per standard deviation increase) and categorical variables (irregular: 025th percentile, moderately irregular: 2575th percent- ile, regular: 75100th percentile). All models adopted the time since accelerometer deployment as the temporal scale. Two models were constructed. Model 1 adjusted for age at recruit- ment, sex, BMI, and ethnicity. Model 2 further adjusted for annual household income, education level, smoking status, Townsend deprivation index, alcohol consumption status, phys- ical activity level, healthy diet score, shift work, the season of accelerometer wear, and sleep duration. Furthermore, to explore potential nonlinear relationships between sleep patterns and mental health outcomes, we applied restricted cubic spline (RCS) models with four knots (at the 5th, 35th, 65th, and 95th percentiles), adjusting for all covariates included in Model 2.

To comprehensively examine the potential interaction and combined effects of SRI and meeting the recommended sleep duration on the risk of anxiety and depression, a joint analysis was conducted. Participants were categorized into six distinct groups based on combinations of SRI levels and sleep duration categories, with the group characterized by regular sleep patterns and meeting the recommended sleep duration as the reference. Stratified analyses were performed to evaluate the independent effects of sleep regularity on anxiety and depression risk within subgroups defined by sleep duration. The multiplicative inter- action between SRI and sleep duration was evaluated using the interactionR package in R. In the joint and stratified analyses, sleep duration was treated as a grouping variable rather than a covariate to avoid overadjustment. Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine whether the associations varied across specific demographic and lifestyle factors. These factors were guided by previous literature, includ- ing age at recruitment, sex, BMI, education level, annual house- hold income, Townsend deprivation index, diet quality, and physical activity level (Kandola et al., 2021; Dankang et al., 2023; Lv et al., 2024; Xu, Yin, & Gong, 2023). To ensure the robustness and reliability of the primary findings, several sensi- tivity analyses were conducted: (1) excluding participants diag- nosed with depression or anxiety within the first 2, 5, and 7 years of follow-up to reduce potential reverse causation bias (Lu et al., 2024); (2) removing individuals with missing or incomplete covariate data; (3) further adjusted for: polygenic risk scores for depression and anxiety (Supplementary Method 1), region, chronotype (morning-type or evening-type preference), neuroti- cism scores from the revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Lyall et al., 2018), history of chronic diseases at baseline, includ- ing hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia (Cribb et al., 2023); (4) re", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 15971, "end_char": 18423}, {"chunk_id": "li2025regular_chunk_011", "source_id": "li2025regular", "text": " years of follow-up to reduce potential reverse causation bias (Lu et al., 2024); (2) removing individuals with missing or incomplete covariate data; (3) further adjusted for: polygenic risk scores for depression and anxiety (Supplementary Method 1), region, chronotype (morning-type or evening-type preference), neuroti- cism scores from the revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Lyall et al., 2018), history of chronic diseases at baseline, includ- ing hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia (Cribb et al., 2023); (4) redefining depression and anxiety cases using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 and Generalized Anxiety Dis- order (GAD)-7 questionnaires administered between 2016 and 2017 to avoid bias from relying solely on medical records.

Results Participant characteristics This study included a total of 79,666 participants, with an average follow-up time of 7.5 years (interquartile range: 6.988.05 years). During the follow-up period, 1,646 (2.07%) participants were diag- nosed with depression, and 2,097 (2.63%) were diagnosed with anxiety. The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of participants, stratified by sleep regularity, are presented in Table 1. Compared with participants with irregular sleep patterns, those with regular sleep patterns were younger, had a higher proportion of females, and exhibited a lower BMI. Participants with regular sleep patterns also reported higher income levels and lower pro- portions of current smoking and alcohol consumption.

Comparison of included versus excluded participants revealed modest differences in baseline characteristics (Supplementary Table 3). Additionally, we examined the correlation between SRI and sleep duration. The weak correlation (r = 0.16, P < 0.001) suggests that these two sleep parameters capture distinct dimensions of sleep health. SRI with anxiety and depression risk The associations between SRI and risks of anxiety and depression are presented in Table 2. In the fully adjusted models, each standard deviation increase in SRI was associated with a 14% decreased risk of depression (95% CI: 0.82, 0.90) and a 12% decreased risk of anxiety (95% CI: 0.85, 0.92). The RCS curve demonstrated a significant linear doseresponse relationship between SRI and risk of depression and anxiety, as shown in Figure 1. When SRI scores were categorized, individuals with moderate irregular sleep pat- terns (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.90 for depression; HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.91 for anxiety) and regular sleep patterns (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.73 for depression; HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.58, 0", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 22143, "end_char": 23697}, {"chunk_id": "li2025regular_chunk_016", "source_id": "li2025regular", "text": "RI and risk of depression and anxiety, as shown in Figure 1.

The association between SRI and mental health outcomes persisted after adjusting for sleep duration, confirming that sleep regularity represents an independent risk factor beyond sleep quantity alone. The results of subgroup analyses consistently supported the primary findings (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Additionally, significant multiplicative interactions were observed between the Townsend deprivation index and SRI on anxiety risk and between age and SRI on depression risk (all P for interaction <0.001). The observed associations remained robust in all sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Tables 610). Stratified analysis of SRI with depression and anxiety risks by sleep duration Figure 2 illustrates the joint effects of sleep regularity and duration. Compared with participants who had regular sleep patterns and met duration guidelines, those with both irregular sleep and non- recommended duration had a 91% higher risk of depression (95% CI: 1.55, 2.35) and a 61% higher risk of anxiety (95% CI: 1.35, 1.93) (Supplementary Tables 11 and 12). In stratified analyses (Figure 3), irregular sleep was linked to greater depression and anxiety risks regardless of whether partici- pants met duration recommendations. Even among those who achieved the recommended sleep duration, individuals in the low- est SRI category had a 48% higher risk of depression (95% CI: 1.18, 1.86) and a 35% higher risk of anxiety (95% CI: 1.11, 1.64) com- pared with regular sleepers.

Notably, even among participants meeting recommended sleep duration guidelines, those with irregular sleep patterns still exhib- ited significantly elevated risks of both conditions compared with the regular sleep group. These results align with and expand upon recent investigations into sleep regularity as an emerging health indicator. Lyall et al. first linked disrupted circadian rhythmicity with mental health through a cross-sectional study (Lyall et al., 2018). Cribb et al. demonstrated that irregular sleepwake patterns were associated with higher mortality risk in the UK Biobank cohort, with HR exhibiting a nonlinear doseresponse relationship (Cribb et al., 2023). Similarly, Chaput et al. found that moderate and high sleep irregularity were associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, even among participants who achieved the recommended sleep duration (Chaput et al., 2024). Our findings regarding mental health outcomes com- plement these studies on physical health, highlighting sleep regularity as a critical dimension beyond traditional sleep parameters. The observed linear relationship between SRI and a decreased risk of depression and anxiety suggests that even modest improvements in sleep regularity might yield mental health benefits, underscoring the importance of consistent sleepwake patterns. Additionally, our subgroup and interaction analyses found that regular sleep was more strongly associated with a reduced risk of Figure 1.

These findings align with previous research showing that younger individuals tend to have more sensitive circadian rhythms (Liao, Shi, Li, & Han, 2025), and that socio- economic hardship can amplify the physiological and psychological effects of sleep disruption, leading to increased mental health risks (Etindele, Faustin, Holmes, & Weinstein, 2021). These results suggest that improving sleep regularity may be an effective and low-cost strategy to mitigate depression and anxiety risks in high- risk groups, particularly younger populations and socioeconomi- cally disadvantaged individuals. The association between sleep regularity and mental health outcomes, persisting after stratification by sleep duration, is par- ticularly noteworthy. This relationship parallels findings by Zheng et al. and Yiallourou et al., who observed that sleep regularity and duration were all important factors associated with health condi- tions (Zheng et al., 2024), and sleep regularity displayed a U-shaped association with risk of incident dementia, operating through mechanisms distinct from sleep duration alone (Yiallourou et al., 2024). Collectively, these findings highlight that maintaining regu- lar sleepwake cycles may be equally or potentially more important than achieving recommended sleep duration. Several plausible biological mechanisms may explain the observed associations between sleep regularity and mental health outcomes. First, irregular sleep patterns can disrupt the synchron- ization of central and peripheral circadian clocks (Charrier et al", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 29240, "end_char": 31901}, {"chunk_id": "li2025regular_chunk_021", "source_id": "li2025regular", "text": " duration were all important factors associated with health condi- tions (Zheng et al., 2024), and sleep regularity displayed a U-shaped association with risk of incident dementia, operating through mechanisms distinct from sleep duration alone (Yiallourou et al., 2024). Collectively, these findings highlight that maintaining regu- lar sleepwake cycles may be equally or potentially more important than achieving recommended sleep duration. Several plausible biological mechanisms may explain the observed associations between sleep regularity and mental health outcomes. First, irregular sleep patterns can disrupt the synchron- ization of central and peripheral circadian clocks (Charrier et al., 2017), potentially altering the expression of clock genes that regu- late various physiological processes. This desynchronization may affect neurotransmitter systems implicated in mood regulation, including serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine (Vadnie & McClung, 2017). Second, disrupted sleepwake cycles may impair hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis function, leading to dysregulated cortisol secretion patterns (Koch et al., 2017). Chronic HPA axis dysfunction has been consistently linked to both depres- sion and anxiety disorders (Gilbert et al., 2017). Third, irregular sleep may compromise prefrontal cortex function and emotion regulation capabilities. Neuroimaging studies have shown that even acute sleep disruption can enhance amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli while reducing functional connectivity with prefrontal regions that modulate emotional responses (Goldstein & Walker, 2014; Krause et al., 2017). Fourth, emerging evidence suggests that sleep irregularity may promote systemic inflammation, as evi- denced by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines observed in individuals with disrupted circadian rhythms (Wright et al., 2015). This is particularly relevant as chronic low-grade inflamma- tion is increasingly recognized as a potential pathophysiological pathway to mood disorders (Miller & Raison, 2016). Additionally, a recent work by Logan and McClung further elucidates how circa- dian disturbances often precede and potentially contribute to mood disorders, suggesting a causal pathway from sleep irregularity to psychiatric symptoms (Logan & McClung, 2019). Our findings have important implications for clinical practice and public health strategies. For public health, our findings Figure 2.

Models were adjusted for age at recruitment, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, annual household income, education level, smoking status, Townsend deprivation index, alcohol consumption status, physical activity level, healthy diet score, employment shift, and season of accelerometer wear. Psychological Medicine 7 https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291725101281 Published online by Cambridge University Press underscore the importance of education about sleep regularity as a modifiable risk factor and could provide additional mental health benefits at the population level. Current sleep guidelines primarily emphasize duration. Our results suggest that these guidelines should be expanded to incorporate recommendations for main- taining regular sleepwake patterns, similar to recent calls by the National Sleep Foundations consensus statement on sleep regular- ity (Sletten et al., 2023). From a clinical perspective, healthcare providers should routinely assess sleep regularity alongside other sleep parameters when evaluating patients sleep health, particu- larly those at risk of or experiencing depression and anxiety (Sun et al., 2025). Simple interventions to improve sleep regularity, such as maintaining consistent bedtimes and wake times, may represent an underutilized approach to mental health prevention and man- agement. Our study has strengths that enhance the reliability and signifi- cance of the findings. The use of wrist-worn accelerometers to objectively measure sleep patterns eliminated the recall bias inherent in self-reported sleep data, providing a more accurate assessment of sleep regularity and duration under free-living conditions. The prospective design, with a large sample size and extended follow-up period, allowed for a robust temporal analysis of the relationship between sleep parameters and subsequent mental health outcomes.

Despite our pro- spective design and multiple sensitivity analyses, the observational nature of our study precludes definitive causal conclusions. Although we excluded incident cases occurring up to 7 years post- baseline and adjusted for subclinical symptoms, we cannot com- pletely rule out reverse causality given the long prodromal phases of depression and anxiety. Furthermore, despite extensive covariate adjustment, including polygenic risk scores and personality traits, Figure 3.

Second, the accelerometer-based assessment of sleep had inherent limitations. The algorithm we used to determine sleep and wake relied on identifying a main sleep period time window and did not account for napping, which may contribute to overall sleep pat- terns. Our sleep regularity assessment was based on a single 7-day measurement period, which may not fully capture long-term sleep patterns or changes over time. Additionally, the accelerometer provides an estimate of sleep based on an algorithm, which may not perfectly align with polysomnography, the gold standard for sleep measurement (Boulos et al., 2019). Third, the predominantly White ethnic composition of the cohort restricts the applicability of results to more diverse populations. Fourth, depression and anxiety diagnoses identified through medical records may underestimate the true prevalence of these conditions, as many individuals with mental health disorders do not seek professional help. Although we supplemented this with questionnaire-based assessments in a sen- sitivity analysis, some cases may still have been missed. Conclusion In conclusion, our study provides compelling evidence that regular sleep patterns are associated with a reduced risk of depression and anxiety. Even among individuals who achieve the recommended sleep duration, consistency in sleepwake timing remains an inde- pendent and significant factor. These results underscore the importance of placing equal emphasis on sleep regularity and duration in depression and anxiety prevention and management.

DOI: 10.5935/1984-0063.20200114 ABSTRACT Introduction: Problematic over usage of smartphones has led to various deteriorating effects including poor sleep quality. Screen exposure, especially near bedtime, directly leads to poor sleep quality. We aimed to measure smartphone screen-time (ST) statistics of the participants directly using a smartphone application. Furthermore, we aimed to assess sleep quality using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), and to investigate the association between ST & PSQI. Material and Methods: This descriptive cohort study was conducted among 280 students of MBBS at Rawalpindi Medical University for a period of 1 month (30 days). Physically healthy students who owned Android smartphones were included in the study. Students with diagnosed sleep disorders and students taking sleep medication were excluded from the study. ST was recorded using a smartphone application. Sleep quality was assessed at the end of 30 days using the PSQI questionnaire. Data entry and analysis was done using SPSS v23.0. Results: Total and mean ST were calculated for every participant. The mean screen time of 242 individuals was 147.5051.09 hours. The mean PSQI score was 6.682.3. 65.70% of the participants had a poor sleep quality (PSQI>5). Pearsons correlation revealed that long total ST was associated with decreased sleep quality (R=0.356, p<0.001).

Sleep Sci. 2021;14(4):337-341 INTRODUCTION The advent of smartphones took the world by storm, and smartphones have nearly become ubiquitous, especially in the developed and developing countries. This has led, inevitably, to smartphone dependency and excessive usage. Problematic over usage of smartphones has manifested as an array of deteriorating effects including poor sleep quality. Smartphone usage, especially near bedtime, worsens ones experience of sleep and directly leads to poor sleep quality. The encyclopedia of behavioral medicine defines sleep quality as ones satisfaction of the sleep experience, integrating aspects of sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, quantity, and refreshment upon awakening1. Smartphone screens emit blue light in the short wavelength region (380nm to 495nm). This blue light is considered to be responsible for suppressing the production of melatonin hormone, which is one of the key components in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. This leads to sleep disturbances and contributes to poor sleep quality2. Sleep disturbances have drastic adverse effects on physical and mental health. Poor sleep quality has been reported to increase the risk of weight gain, obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, glucose intolerance, and diabetes3-6. Sleep deprivation negatively affects cognitive functions7 and can also lead to depression, stress, and anxiety8,9. This study aimed to directly measure the duration for which a person uses the smartphone, i.e., screen time (ST) and to find an association between ST and sleep quality, quantitatively measured by Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). There is a multitude of studies that have been conducted among students to explore the prevalence of decreased sleep quality10-12, but there is a scarcity of studies investigating the direct associations between sleep quality and smartphone usage. Thus, we aim to contribute to this knowledge gap.

This study aimed to directly measure the duration for which a person uses the smartphone, i.e., screen time (ST) and to find an association between ST and sleep quality, quantitatively measured by Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). There is a multitude of studies that have been conducted among students to explore the prevalence of decreased sleep quality10-12, but there is a scarcity of studies investigating the direct associations between sleep quality and smartphone usage. Thus, we aim to contribute to this knowledge gap. Recognizing the adverse effects of excessive phone usage on sleep quality, and subsequently on the mental and physical health of the subjects would necessitate the importance of timely interventions and remedies. MATERIAL AND METHODS Participants recruitment and characteristics This descriptive cohort study was conducted among 280 students of MBBS at Rawalpindi Medical University, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, for a period of one month from 8th July 2019 to 7th August 2019 (30 days). Ethical approval was taken from the ethical review board prior to participant recruitment and data collection. Participants were sampled using non- randomized consecutive sampling. Physically healthy students who owned an android smartphone were included in the study. Students with diagnosed insomnia or other sleep disorders and students taking sleep medication were excluded from the study. Consent was obtained from all participants and the aims and procedures of the study were explained to them. Study procedures and data collection: screen time Participants were instructed to download and install an Android smartphone application. This application tracked ST duration and reported it in the form of a bar chart. The bar chart displayed daily usage statistics of seven days separately at a given time. The usage duration data could also be exported as an Excel Spreadsheet (.xlsx). The participants were approached once every week (for a total of 4 weeks) and were instructed to send a screenshot of the bar chart along with the Excel Spreadsheet. Data of two additional days were also collected to make a total of 30 days. Participants for whom the complete data of 30 days was available were selected for entry and analysis. Participants with missing or incomplete data were excluded. Study procedures and data collection: sleep quality Sleep quality was assessed at the end of 30 days using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) questionnaire. Poor sleep quality was defined as a global PSQI score>5. PSQI scores were entered as a scale variable while measuring the association with ST.

Poor sleep quality was defined as a global PSQI score>5. PSQI scores were entered as a scale variable while measuring the association with ST. An online form version of the original questionnaire was sent to the participants. Global PSQI score and total ST were assessed for possible associations. Analytic approach Data entry and analysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA). Means and standard deviations were used to report normally distributed variables. Pearsons chi-square test, independent samples T-test, Pearsons correlation test, and linear regression were performed. RESULTS The study included 280 participants, amongst which 48.93% (n=137) were males and 51.07% (n=143) were females. The mean age was 21.891.73 years. Complete data was available for 242 participants (males: 47.93% (n=116), females: 52.06% (n=126)). 27 had missing data, 11 dropped out of the study for various reasons (change of consent: 8, uninstalled the application: 3). For each of these 242 participants, total and average ST were calculated. Global PSQI scores were also entered for each participant. Prevalence of poor sleep quality: 65.70% (n=159) of participants had poor sleep quality (PSQI>5) and 34.29% (n=83) had good sleep quality. The mean PSQI score was 6.682.3. Mean PSQI scores in participants with poor and good sleep qualities were 7.981.66 and 4.180.76, respectively (p0.001). Males were prone to have poorer sleep quality than females. This difference was elicited by chi-square test. 72.41% (n=84) of the males had poor sleep quality. In contrast, 59.52% (n=75) females had poor sleep quality (p= 0", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 5748, "end_char": 7843}, {"chunk_id": "arshad2021adverse_chunk_005", "source_id": "arshad2021adverse", "text": " and 34.29% (n=83) had good sleep quality.

Sleep Sci. 2021;14(4):337-341 339 Effect of excessive smartphone screen time on sleep quality Screen-time statistics The mean ST of 30 days was 147.5051.09 hours. The maximum ST was 247.03 hours and the minimum ST was 22.50 hours.. There was a significant difference in the mean ST between the genders, as shown in Table 1. Mean ST for females (140.3849.38) was lesser than for males (155.2351.99) (p=0.024). Mean ST for participants with poor sleep quality was 152.6356.74, while for those with good sleep quality was 137.6736.34 (p=0.030). These results described above have been summarized in Table 1. Association of screen time and sleep quality Pearsons correlation and simple linear regression revealed a strong positive association of ST and PSQI score (R=0.356, p0.001). R-squared change of 0.127 showed that 12.7% of the variance in sleep quality can be attributed to ST. These results are represented in Table 2. DISCUSSION Sleep is crucial for maintaining an adequate and healthy lifestyle. It can be considered as a maintenance and repair period of the body during which the metabolites that have accumulated throughout the day are cleared, and mental stress and anxiety are relieved. Hence it goes without saying that anything that disturbs the sleep pattern impairs these protective and repair functions, and leads to physical as well as mental manifestations13,14. The regulation of sleep is a multi-factorial process. The pineal gland, and its hormone melatonin, play a major role in the regulation of the circadian rhythm and sleep initiation. Melatonin is produced at night in a dark environment.

Hence it goes without saying that anything that disturbs the sleep pattern impairs these protective and repair functions, and leads to physical as well as mental manifestations13,14. The regulation of sleep is a multi-factorial process. The pineal gland, and its hormone melatonin, play a major role in the regulation of the circadian rhythm and sleep initiation. Melatonin is produced at night in a dark environment. Short-wavelength blue light (380-495nm) is known to adversely affect melatonin production2,15. This dose-dependent suppression of melatonin production in turn leads to sleep disruption2. Poor sleep quality has been associated with excessive weight gain and obesity3,4,16. Poor sleep quality may also be associated with negative academic performance17. Insufficient sleep has also been linked with an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome5 and diabetes mellitus18. Shorter sleep duration is associated with an increased risk for hypertension, especially in individuals under the age of 656. It also negatively affects attention, working memory, and other cognitive functions7. Various studies have also reported an association of poor sleep quality with depression and anxiety8,9. Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) is a reliable and validated self-administered questionnaire, which assesses sleep quality over a period of thirty (30) days. It defines poor sleep quality as a global PSQI score>5 (89.6% sensitivity and 86.5% specificity). In accordance with this, the major proportion of our participants had poor sleep quality (65.70%, n=159). This indicates a high prevalence of poor sleep quality. Many similar studies conducted among students have shown this trend. A 2015 study conducted among medical students of Karachi, Pakistan, reported that 39.5% of its subjects had poor sleep quality10.

To put these two numbers into perspective, these equate to 6.15 and 10.29 days per month of phone usage, respectively. Indeed, these numbers are alarmingly high. Furthermore, ST came out to be strongly positively correlated with the PSQI score. PSQI score for the maximum- recorded ST was 11, indicating a poor sleep quality. Results reveal that at least a 12.7% variance in sleep quality is explained by ST. A self-reported questionnaire-based study conducted among Chinese medical students reported that excessive ST was significantly associated with poor sleep quality. The participants, which included 4,915 college students, reported time spent on computers and watching TV/video games. This ST was categorized as 2 hours/day and >2 hours/day. Data analysis revealed that participants in the latter category had poorer sleep quality (OR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.06-1.65)19. Another study conducted at Wuhan University also used similar methods to find out the association between ST with sleep quality, while investigating other factors too. This study also used self-reported ST categorized as 2 hours/day and >2 hours/day and found that participants in the former category were less likely to have poor sleep quality (OR=1.11, 95% CI: 0.77-1.58)20. A cross-sectional study conducted on 1,674 US adults investigated the association of sedentary time and ST with sleep outcomes. It categorized participants self-reported ST into 4 categories: 2.0h/day; 2.1-4.0h/day; 4.1-6.0h/day; >6h/day. Statistical analysis revealed that participants in category 4 (>6h/ day) had 3.1-fold higher odds of reporting sleep difficulties compared to those in the first category21. All three of these studies confirm the findings of our study. However, these studies utilize self-reported ST statistics, which can be different from actual usage duration.

All three of these studies confirm the findings of our study. However, these studies utilize self-reported ST statistics, which can be different from actual usage duration. People tend to under-report their usage times, as observed by a study conducted among university students in Taiwan, in 2015, which found out that their participants grossly underestimated their smartphone usage duration22. Our study, therefore, removes this participant bias of under or overreporting their ST by directly measuring it as a continuous variable. Another study conducted among US adults also measured ST directly using an android smartphone application. This study also found out that poor sleep quality (PSQI>5) and longer ST were significantly associated with each other. However, this particular observation was based on the data of 56 participants (out of 653 participants that had completed the core survey) that had complete ST and PSQI data23. Our study incorporates a relatively larger number of participants (n=242) to establish this association. Our findings highlight the necessity of curbing excessive smartphone usage as well as exploring remedies to ameliorate poor sleep quality. Using blue light filters for screens can attenuate the harmful effects of blue light on sleep24. Bedtime phone usage restriction has also been found beneficial to increase sleep duration25. The use of melatonin supplements is proposed to increase sleep duration and decrease sleep latency26. This study successfully concludes, in accordance with previous studies done on the subject, that excessive smartphone usage is one of the factors contributing to adverse sleep quality. To evaluate the remaining variance in decreased sleep quality was beyond the scope of this study. The remaining variance in sleep quality may be attributed to other factors such as anxiety and emotional stress, as reported by other studies27,28. It is also important to state that these results alone are not enough to establish causation. Further researches and experimental study designs are needed to establish temporality and cause-effect relationships. The Bradford Hill criteria can be used as a guideline in this regard29.

Furthermore, we could not account for ST other than smartphones, which includes laptops and television screens. A multivariate analysis accounting for ST across all devices as well as taking into account other factors that influence sleep quality would provide a more inclusive and comprehensive overview. CONCLUSIONS The findings of our study are in accordance with past researches done on the subject and reaffirm that young adults spend a significant amount of time using smartphones, which directly leads to decreased sleep quality. This subsequently predisposes them to multiple adverse physical as well as psychological health outcomes. It is therefore recommended to take measures to decrease ST, particularly in the hours prior to sleeping. The use of blue light filters for screens should be advised, since blue light decreases sleep quality. CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

Multivariable logistic regression analyzed the association between unhealthy sleep and CVD. Weighted data were used for restricted cubic spline (RCS) plots to assess the nonlinear relationship between sleep durations, bedtime, rising time and CVD. Results Adjusted models showed significant associations between poor sleep and heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke and hypertension (p < 0.05). Daytime sleepiness also increased stroke and hypertension risks (p < 0.05). RCS plots revealed nonlinear relationships: 79 hours sleep/day minimized heart failure, myocardial infarction and hypertension risks; 68 hours/day minimized stroke risk. Bedtime showed J-shaped and U-shaped associations with myocardial infarction and hypertension. PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326499 July 11, 2025 2 / 18 Conclusion This nationally representative survey revealed that poor sleep patterns, particularly sleep disorders, daytime sleepiness and reported breathing obstructions were signifi cantly associated with an increased prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. Addition ally, there was a nonlinear correlation between sleep duration, bedtime, rising time and the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Introduction According to the 2023 WHO Health Guidelines, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains one of the leading causes of death from non-communicable diseases glob ally, with approximately 17.9 million deaths attributed to CVD in 2019 [1]. CVD is the result of a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and lifestyle factors. An indispensable approach to preventing and controlling CVD is to focus on reducing associated risk factors. Traditional modifiable risk factors include smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity. By adjusting lifestyle habits, the negative impact of all these factors on cardiovascular health can be mitigated. Sleep is one of the important indicators reflecting overall human health.

An indispensable approach to preventing and controlling CVD is to focus on reducing associated risk factors. Traditional modifiable risk factors include smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity. By adjusting lifestyle habits, the negative impact of all these factors on cardiovascular health can be mitigated. Sleep is one of the important indicators reflecting overall human health. Unhealthy sleep factors, such as too little or too much sleep, sleep disorders, snoring and frequent daytime sleepiness, have been shown to have a certain correlation with CVD [24]. These sleep factors are often interrelated, and their combination may increase the risk of CVD [5,6]. However, most studies have examined the association between a single sleep factor and the risk of a single cardiovascular disease, without considering the intertwined relationships between multiple sleep factors and multiple cardiovascular diseases. Li found that participants in the UK Biobank with healthy sleep patterns (early sleepers, sleeping 78 hours per day, self-reporting no snoring, no frequent insomnia and no frequent excessive daytime sleepiness) had a lower risk of heart failure [7]. However, the study did not describe the risk of other cardiovascular diseases or provide details on specific bedtime and rising time. Another study found a significant associa tion between late bedtime on weekdays and weekends and an increased prevalence of angina [8], but it did not explore other sleep factors or cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, we utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to investigate the relationship between combinations of key sleep factors characterized by a healthy sleep score and the risks of heart failure, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, stroke and hypertension. Our aim was to assess the potential interaction between overall sleep patterns and CVD. Subsequently, we also examined the individual effects of each sleep factor on CVD to comprehensively explore the relationship between sleep and CVD.

It employs a complex, multistage probability sampling method to select a representative sample of the US population every two years in order to assess the health and nutritional status of the American population. The National Center for Health Statistics Institutional Review Board approved this survey, and each participant signed an informed consent form before completing the questionnaire and undergoing laboratory tests. This study included data from 2017 to 2020, and all data were obtained from the NHANES website (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm). In the original NHANES survey, responses coded as missing, refused, or dont know were treated as missing data. Initially, a total of 15,560 samples were included. Participants were excluded from further analysis if they (1) lacked information on sleep (such as bedtime, rising time, sleepduration and sleepduration. n = 1,091) or (2) had missing data on cardiovascular dis eases (such as heart failure, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, stroke and hypertension, n = 6,394). The final sample for analysis consisted of 8,075 participants, and the flowchart of the study sample is presented in Fig 1. Cardiovascular disease ascertainment Through household interviews, participants who responded yes to the series of questions in the medical conditions section of the household questionnaire, such as Has a doctor or other health professional ever told you that you have heart failure/ angina pectoris/ myocardial infarction/ stroke/ hypertension? were considered to have the respective condition. Additionally, participants with a mean of three blood pressure measurements 140/90 mmHg were considered to have hypertension. Fig 1.

These questions were asked in the home, by trained interviewers, using the Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system. We included seven aspects from the sleep habits questionnaire: bedtime, rising time, sleep duration, frequency of snoring, frequency of snort or stop breathing, trouble sleeping and sleepy during day. By calculating the bedtime, rising time and sleep duration, we obtained participants usual sleep patterns: Sleep duration = (weekday sleep duration  5 + weekend sleep duration  2)/ 7 Bedtime = (weekday bedtime  5 + weekend bedtime  2)/ 7 rising time = (weekday rising time  5 + weekend rising time  2)/ 7 The sleep score is composed of five sleep factors: sleep duration, snoring, snort or stop breathing, trouble sleeping and sleepy during day, referencing previous relevant studies [2,7,9]. Participants who have short or long sleep durations (<7h/d or> 8h/d) [4] and have ever told a doctor about sleep disturbances receive a score of 1. The other unhealthy sleep factors are scored based on their frequency, with higher frequencies resulting in higher scores (Table 1). The total sleep score is obtained by summing the scores of the five sleep factors, ranging from 0 to 12. We categorized the overall sleep patterns into three groups based on the distribution of sleep scores: healthy sleep pattern (sleep score 04), inter mediate sleep pattern (sleep score 58) and poor sleep pattern (sleep score 912).

Smoking and drinking status were divided into former, current or never smokers/drinkers. Body Mass Index (BMI) was categorized into four categories: underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.525 kg/m2), overweight (2530 kg/m2) and obese (30 kg/m2). The duration of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary time were determined based on the exercise questionnaire section. Statistical analyses NHANES provides weights for each participant to account for design, non-response and stratification adjustments in order to represent the general population of the United States. Weighted population data were used to analyze the association between sleep quality, sleep duration, bedtime, rising time and the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. Participant characteristics were compared using chi-square tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Baseline information for categorical variables was presented as unweighted frequencies and weighted percentages, while continuous variables were rep resented by weighted medians and quartiles. To further explore the impact of covariates on sleep and cardiovascular diseases, we employed logistic regression to establish Model 1 (roughly adjusted for age and gender) and Model 2 (fully adjusted model: age, gender, race, smoking status, drinking status and diabetes). Furthermore, weighted data were used to construct restricted cubic spline plots with 4 knots to analyze the association between different bedtimes, rising times and cardiovascular diseases. Restricted cubic spline plots approximate given data points by cubic polynomials to gener ate smooth curves that are smoothly connected over neighboring intervals with additional smoothness constraints to avoid sharp fluctuations in the curves. In regression analysis, restricted cubic spline plots capture the nonlinear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, and the number of nodes recommended by most researchers is 35 to avoid overfitting while maintaining smoothness.

Results The baseline characteristics of study population This research included 8075 subjects at baseline assessment, In Table 1, five cardiovascular diseases were used as outcome indicators, and factors such as age, gender, and race were examined in relation to them to summarize the characteristics of the participants in more detail. Age, race, education, smoking status, BMI and waist were significantly associated with cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypertension and stroke), with a statistically significant higher risk of heart failure and hypertension in older adults, men, those with higher educa tion, smoking, higher BMI and waist, longer sedentary time, poorer sleep patterns and a history of diabetes (P < 0.05). Regarding the risk of myocardial infarction, older people, men, higher education, smoking, alcohol consumption, higher BMI and waist, poorer sleep patterns and a history of diabetes mellitus were the high-risk groups (P < 0.05).

Bad sleep patterns (including intermediate and poor sleep patterns) were more common among subjects with cardiovascular diseases (including heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, stroke and hyperten sion) (Table 2,Fig 2). The association between sleep pattern and risk of cardiovascular diseases In the model adjusted for age and gender (Model 1, Fig 3. A1 ~ A5), higher sleep scores were associated with higher inci dences of heart failure, myocardial infarction, hypertension and stroke (p < 0.01). Subjects with poor sleep patterns had a higher risk of stroke and hypertension (p < 0.05). Compared to subjects with healthy sleep patterns, those with poor sleep patterns had a 3.05-fold and 2.63-fold higher likelihood of developing heart failure and myocardial infarction, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounding factors (Model 2, Fig 3. B1, B4, B5), sleep scores still had an impact on heart failure, hypertension and stroke (Model 2, Fig 3. B1, B2, B4, B5, p < 0.05).

The impact of poorer sleep patterns on heart failure (OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.254.62), myocardial infarction (2.14(1.02,4.49)), and stroke (2.23(1.31,3.79)) remained statistically significant (p < 0.05). The poorer the sleep pattern, the higher the risk of hypertension, which was 1.8 and 2.53 times higher than that of people with normal sleep patterns (Fig 3. B4, p < 0.001). In model 1 (Fig 3. A1 ~ A5), various components of sleep patterns were associated with heart failure, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, stroke and hypertension in patients with sleep disorders (p < 0.05). After full adjustment in the model, these associations remained significant for heart failure, angina pectoris, stroke and hypertension (p < 0.05). Reported breathing obstructions was found to promote the occurrence of heart failure and hypertension. Subjects who reported day time drowsiness exhibited a higher risk of stroke and hypertension risks, which were statistically significant in both model 1 (Fig 3. A4 ~ A5) and model 2 (Fig 3. B4 ~ B5) (p < 0.05, p < 0.05). Additionally, the frequency of snoring was positively cor related with hypertension (p < 0.01), while sleep duration seemed to have little association with cardiovascular diseases, with only a significant impact on stroke in model 2 (p = 0.045). We also did subgroup analyses stratified by age, adjusting for all potential confounding factors mentioned above except for the subgroup variable itself. The results of the age-stratified analysis are presented in Fig 4. In the group aged <50 years, poorer sleep scores were associated with higher risks of heart failure, myocardial infarction and hypertension. In the 5070-year-old group, sleep scores were positively correlated with hypertension. In the  70-year-old group, poorer sleep scores contributed to the occurrence of hypertension and stroke. Across all three age subgroups, poorer sleep scores consistently increased the risk of hypertension by 1.16, 1.08 and 1.12 times, respectively (p < 0.01).

In the group aged <50 years, poorer sleep scores were associated with higher risks of heart failure, myocardial infarction and hypertension.

The association between sleep duration and risk of cardiovascular diseases To further investigate the correlation between sleep duration and cardiovascular diseases, we subsequently plotted restricted cubic spline graphs (Fig 5). As can be seen from Fig 5 A,B, D and E, there is a nonlinear association among sleep duration and heart failure, myocardial infarction, hypertension and stroke (p < 0.01). Specifically, when sleep dura tion falls within the range of 79 hours per day, the risks of heart failure, myocardial infarction and hypertension are low. For stroke, the lowest risk is observed with a sleep duration of 68 hours per day. Both insufficient and excessive sleep durations increase the risks of heart failure, myocardial infarction and hypertension. The association between bedtime and risk of cardiovascular diseases Based on the restricted cubic spline graphs, we observed a nonlinear relationship between bedtime and cardiovascular diseases (Fig 6). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, we found no correlation between bedtime and heart failure, angina pectoris or stroke (Fig 6A, C,E; p > 0.05). However, there was a J-shaped association between bedtime and myocardial infarction and a U-shaped association with hypertension (Fig 6 B,D; p < 0.05).

The association between rising time and risk of cardiovascular diseases Using restricted cubic spline analysis, we examined the nonlinear relationship between wake-up time and cardiovascular diseases (Fig 7). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, we found a J-shaped association between wake-up time and myocardial infarction (Fig 7B, p < 0.01). The optimal wake-up time was around 6 a.m. As can be seen from the figure, waking up later had a promoting effect on the risk of myocardial infarction (p < 0.05). Discussion Based on the NHANES, we conducted multi-level analyses of sleep-related factors such as bedtime, rising time and sleep patterns among patients with cardiovascular diseases. The results revealed that compared to healthy sleep patterns, intermediate and poor sleep patterns promoted the occurrence and development of cardiovascular diseases. Specifi cally, trouble sleeping were associated with heart failure, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, stroke and hypertension. Reported breathing obstructions contributed to the occurrence of heart failure and hypertension, and a higher frequency of sleepy during day was associated with a greater risk of stroke and hypertension. Additionally, the frequency of snoring was positively correlated with hypertension risk. Logistic regression analysis showed that sleep duration had only a limited impact on stroke, while nonlinear analysis demonstrated statistically significant associations between sleep duration and heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke and hypertension. Further studies were conducted to investigate the relationship between bedtime, rising time and cardiovascular dis eases. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) graphs were plotted, and the results indicated a J-shaped association between bedtime and myocardial infarction and a U-shaped association between bedtime and hypertension. The risks of myocar dial infarction and hypertension were lowest when falling asleep around 22:00 and 23:00, respectively. Wake-up time also exhibited a J-shaped association with myocardial infarction, with the lowest risk observed when waking up around 6:00 a.m. Fig 2.

However, there is no consensus on the impact of individual sleep factors such as sleep duration, bedtime and rising time on cardiovascular diseases. Some studies suggest that both long and short sleep durations are associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases [2,11], while others argue that only short sleep duration is a potential causal risk factor for several cardiovascular diseases, and that long sleep duration is not causally related to most cardiovascular diseases [13,14].

To address this, we established a logistic regression model examining the correlation between sleep duration and cardiovascular diseases. The results indicated that sleep duration only had an impact on stroke. To further investigate the nonlinear relationship between sleep duration and cardiovascular diseases, we plotted restricted cubic spline graphs. These revealed that the optimal daily sleep duration is approximately 79 hours, consistent with previous research [4,10]. Both shorter and longer sleep durations increase the risk of heart failure, myo cardial infarction and hypertension. Sleep deprivation causes deterioration of vascular structure and function, and even one night of sleep deprivation is associated with increased arterial stiffness in healthy adults [15]. Among those 65 years old, long sleep duration is significantly associated with atherosclerosis [16]. In other words, both long and short sleep durations lead to endothelial damage and atherosclerosis, increasing the risk of hypertension and myocardial infarction. Sleep apnea is an independent risk factor for the occurrence and progression of cardiovascular diseases. The prev alence of sleep apnea among cardiovascular diseases patients is as high as 40% to 80%, and the prognosis for these patients is poorer [17,18]. Patients with sleep apnea often have elevated sympathetic tone, oxidative stress, inflamma tory reactions, endothelial dysfunction and metabolic disorders (such as insulin resistance and leptin resistance). These factors interact and contribute to the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases [19]. Our study also found that subjects with reported breathing obstructions had a higher risk of hypertension and heart failure, consistent with previous research. In addition, subjects who self-reported sleep disorders had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular dis eases. Studies have found that mice with myocardial infarction experience a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction and increased expression of IL-1, IL-18, and IL-10-mRNA after sleep deprivation. This suggests that sleep disorders can increase inflammatory reactions after myocardial infarction, promoting or aggravating heart failure [20].

This further supports the relationship between sleep disorders and cardiovascular diseases [21]. Moreover, cardiovascular diseases can lead to inflammatory macrophage accumulation in the superior cervical ganglia (SCG), fibrosis and selective loss of pineal neuron function, resulting in reduced melatonin levels and disrupted sleep- wake cycles, further exacerbating sleep disorders and creating a vicious cycle [5,22]. To explore the association between overall sleep patterns and cardiovascular diseases, we integrated five sleep factors and established a logistic model using healthy sleep patterns as a reference. We found that subjects with imtermedi ate and poor sleep patterns had a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases, and this remained statistically significant after adjusting for covariates. This is similar to previous studies on the relationship between sleep patterns and cardiovascular diseases [2,23]. Therefore, there is a close relationship between sleep and the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Subsequently, we adjusted for covariates to analyze the correlation between sleep scores and different age groups. The results revealed that sleep has a greater impact on the incidence of cardiovascular disease among people aged under 50 (p < 0.05). Compared to the elderly, young and middle-aged adults have a faster metabolic rate, which may result in a more significant impact of sleep on the cardiovascular system. Additionally, due to their faster work pace, irregular lifestyle and higher mental stress, young and middle-aged adults are more likely to have poor sleep habits such as insuf ficient sleep and staying up. In contrast, older adults often have lower homeostatic sleep pressure, exhibit less rebound sleep under conditions of sleep deprivation and report less subjective daytime sleepiness [24]. Therefore, the risk of car diovascular disease in older adults is less affected by sleep. To further explore the nonlinear relationship between bedtime, rising time and cardiovascular disease and to identify healthier sleep patterns, we plotted restricted cubic spline graphs.

The results revealed a nonlinear correlation between bedtime and the risk of myocardial infarction and hypertension. Specifically, falling asleep around 22:00 was associated with the lowest risk of hypertension. Previous studies have also shown that late bedtime can promote the occurrence of myocardial infarction, and the underlying mechanisms may involve higher resting heart rate, blood pressure and epineph rine levels, and late bedtime can lead to increased levels of triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein and decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein, thereby increasing the risk of myocardial infarction [25]. The diurnal rhythm of blood pressure is primarily regulated by the diurnal rhythm of the sympathetic nervous system. Normal sleep reduces sympathetic activity, leading to a decrease in blood pressure. However, patients with late bedtime may experience excessive sympathetic excitation, affecting the diurnal rhythm of blood pressure [26]. Furthermore, among patients with hypertension, reduced melatonin production during the night can also affect the decrease in nocturnal blood pressure [5]. In contrast to previous studies, our findings did not show a correlation between bedtime and other cardiovascular diseases such as angina pecto ris [8]. This inconsistency may be related to differences in the selection of outcome indicators and databases. The indica tors chosen in this study were primarily based on self-reported survey questionnaires, while previous studies may have included indicators based on chest pain questionnaires [27]. Additionally, the data included in other studies may have originated from the UK Biobank [28], involving different ethnic and geographic groups, which may also have an impact on the correlation between sleep and cardiovascular disease. Although an epidemiologic association between sleep and cardiovascular disease has been established, the underlying mechanisms are still under discussion. Links between sleep status and body metabolism, such as reduced glucose toler ance, sympathetic nervous system overactivity, circadian rhythms and altered hormone concentrations, are thought to play an important role in the mechanisms of cardiovascular disease.

Subsequent stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration promotes lipid deposition and fibrosis of the arterial wall, facilitating the development of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart disease and heart failure [29]. To date, there are no defined biological mechanisms to explain the association between sleep and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. However, some studies suggest that inflammation may explain the relationship between sleep and cardiovascular disease [30]. It has been found that the inflammatory cascade response occurs when awakened from sleep only once, and that multiple awaken ings and sleep disruption may further exacerbate the inflammatory response [31]. Continuous stress caused by repeated snoring and upper airway closure and reopening can lead to mucosal inflammation, causing upper airway remodelling and increased connective tissue deposition in the mucosa and muscles. Intermittent hypoxia and repeated hypoxia/reoxygen ation cycles induce oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, activation of NF-B, elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and M1-type macrophage recruitment and infiltration in different tissues, such as the vasculature and the heart, which ultimately leads to vascular remodelling, metabolic dysfunction and atherosclerosis [32]. Upper airway obstruction leads to hypoxaemia, hypercapnia and changes in intrathoracic pressure, which, together with frequent sleep arousals, cause sympathetic arousal, increased heart rate, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, and increased blood pressure [33], which in turn develops into left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure. In addition, In addition, Sympathetic activation and hypoxia/reoxygenation cycles triggered by sleep arousal induce oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, with a consequent significant increase in activated Ca MKII levels, a significant increase in Ca MKII- dependent myocardial Na channel phosphorylation, and a dysregulation of atrial myocyte INa, which means the inactivation of atrial myocyte homeostasis leads to the development of cardiac arrhythmias", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 39101, "end_char": 41675}, {"chunk_id": "zhang2025associations_chunk_029", "source_id": "zhang2025associations", "text": " activation of the renin-angiotensin system, and increased blood pressure [33], which in turn develops into left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure.

Suppression of inflammatory response and Ca MK II with continuous positive airway pressure ventilation may reduce sleep-induced cardiovascular risk. Strengths and limitations Compared to previous studies, our research has several advantages. Firstly, we adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and sample size factors to better represent the general population of the United States. This ensures that our findings are more applicable and relevant to a wider audience. Secondly, combined with previous studies, this study try to improve the defects of the sleep questionnaire, and analyzed the overall sleep situation to individual sleep factors. The overall sleep situation of the participants was assessed based on the sleep scores and sleep patterns, and the sleep scores consisted of five sleep factors, and the scores were made based on the frequency of the occurrence of unhealthy sleep factors, and the higher the frequency, the higher the score. Among them, bedtime, rising time, and sleep duration are calculated based on the average value of weekdays and rest days, with a total score of 012, and the higher the score, the poorer the sleep quality. Then we categorized the overall sleep patterns into three groups based on the distribution of sleep scores: healthy sleep pattern (sleep score 04), intermediate sleep pattern (sleep score 58) and poor sleep pattern (sleep score 912). We also assessed the correlation between the frequency of each sleep factor and the risk of cardiovascular disease. In our data analysis, we comprehensively investigated the relationship between various sleep factors and cardiovascu lar diseases. This comprehensive approach allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the multifaceted relationship between sleep and cardiovascular health. Lastly, we conducted subgroup analyses on meaningful results, enabling us to delve deeper into specific subgroups and identify potential differences or patterns within these groups. This adds a layer of nuance and detail to our findings, making them more comprehensive and informative. However, our study still has certain limitations.

Lastly, we conducted subgroup analyses on meaningful results, enabling us to delve deeper into specific subgroups and identify potential differences or patterns within these groups. This adds a layer of nuance and detail to our findings, making them more comprehensive and informative. However, our study still has certain limitations. Firstly, as our research is based on a cross-sectional study from NHANES, the observed relationships cannot directly establish a causal link between sleep and cardiovascular diseases. Future studies may need to utilize longitudinal studies to validate the causal relationship. Secondly, the sleep data in our study were collected through subjective reports, which may introduce recall bias. Participants memories may not be entirely accurate, leading to potential inaccuracies in the data. Sleep monitoring, such as polysomnography, home sleep PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326499 July 11, 2025 17 / 18 monitoring, or multiple sleep latency tests, is recommended for the overall assessment of sleep. However, the sleep data in the NHANES database were generated based on a sleep questionnaire, and participants mostly responded using self-reported responses, which may have recall bias. While the evaluation of sleep status has been refined, this is not a substitute for objective indicators of actual testing, and polysomnography, home sleep monitoring or multiple sleep latency tests should be performed to test sleep in future studies to obtain objective indicators for assessment. Thirdly, the out come variables of the participants should be judged in accordance with a strict diagnostic process, although the NHANES has the collection of participants medication and laboratory test results, part of the data is missing, which causes certain difficulties in the diagnosis of the disease, if this part of the sample is excluded, the sample size will be greatly affected, so we chose the medical condition section of the family questionnaire, although there is recall bias, the data in this section is more complete and easier to analyze.

The relationship between sleep duration, bedtime and wake-up time and the risk of cardiovascular disease is nonlinear, with the optimal sleep duration ranging from 7 to 9 hours per day. Additionally, going to bed late or waking up late can both increase the risk of myocardial infarction. Supporting information S1 Table. The original data.

We summarized evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that investigated the effects of melatonin on sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in adults with various diseases. Methods The literature searches of English publications in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were performed up June 2020. Results were summarized as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random effects model (DerSimonianLaird method). Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated by the Cochrane Q test and I-squared (I2). To determine the predefined sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analysis was performed. Results Of 2642 papers, 23 RCTs met inclusion criteria. Our results indicated that melatonin had significant effect on sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (WMD:  1.24; 95% CI  1.77,  0.71, p = 0.000). There was significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 80.7%, p = 0.000). Subgroup analysis based on health status and kind of intervention were potential between-study heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis based on health status revealed melatonin intervention in subjects with Respiratory diseases (WMD:  2.20; 95% CI  2.97,  1.44, p = 0.000), Metabolic disorders (WMD:  2.74; 95% CI  3.48,  2.00, p = 0.000) and", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 0, "end_char": 1920}, {"chunk_id": "fatemeh2021effect_chunk_002", "source_id": "fatemeh2021effect", "text": " was significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 80.7%, p = 0.000).

Keywords Melatonin  Sleep quality  PSQI  Meta-analysis Introduction Sleep as a physiological and behavioral process is essential for body regulation and quality of life at any age[1]. Nowa- days, sleep quality is often declined, and sleep deprivation or restriction causes several physiological and behavioral changes.[2] Inadequate sleep, in terms of either quantity or quality, is a known risk factor for several diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, vascular disorders, metabolic dysfunction and neurocognitive and leading to an increase in mortality and create a substantial burden on the health care system [36]. Also, the sleep distur- bance causes clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning [7]. Almost a third of the worlds population suffers from sleep disorders, mainly insomnia, because of stressful working conditions and aging and these disorders are more com- mon in women and the elderly [8]. Current medications have substantial adverse events, such as excessive day- time sleepiness, poor tolerance to the medication, cogni- tive impairment, dependency and withdrawal [9]. Due to these side effects, there has been an increased interest to find a new pharmaceutical with less side effects and non- pharmaceutical approach such as yoga, physical exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, acupuncture, mindfulness, * Mirzaei Khadijeh mirzaei_kh@sina.tums.ac.ir 1 Department", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 1513, "end_char": 3811}, {"chunk_id": "fatemeh2021effect_chunk_003", "source_id": "fatemeh2021effect", "text": " from sleep disorders, mainly insomnia, because of stressful working conditions and aging and these disorders are more com- mon in women and the elderly [8].

Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is an endogenous indoleamine that is produced nocturnally by the pineal gland and released into the bloodstream exclu- sively at night following the circadian rhythm. Melatonin is a sleep regulator and signal of darkness in humans [11]. Some randomized, placebo-controlled trials indicated that melatonin intervention cannot improve quality of sleep [12, 13]. However, some of the recent findings published suggest that melatonin is a potent drug candidate for sleep disorders [14, 15]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive review on the efficacy of mela- tonin intervention for the improvement of sleep quality as assessed by the PSQI in different disease. Thus, with accumulating evidence, we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate the roles of exogenous melatonin, versus placebo, in the treatment of sleep quality sleep quality as assessed by the PSQI in adult with various disease.

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and study design that were randomized controlled trial (RCT) were used. Search strategy A throughout search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Embase and Google Scholar from inception to June 2020 with no time restriction. Only articles published in English were considered in this review. We used medical subject headings (MeSH) and text words to identify the potential interest studies. Search words included: Melatonin OR \"Melatonin supplementation\" AND Sleep OR \"Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders\" OR \"Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic\" OR \"Sleep Wake Disorders\" OR \"Men- tal Health\" OR sleep* OR \"sleep quality\" OR mental health\" OR \"Pittsburgh sleep quality index\". We hand searched all reference lists of eligible articles, related reviews, and meta- analyses to prevent missing any relevant studies. Unpub- lished documents and grey literature like conference papers, theses, and patents were not included. Eligibility criteria The included studies in this meta-analysis were as follows: (1) randomized control trials (RCT), (2) only executed on adult population (aged > 18 years) and (3) reported sleep quality as assessed by PSQI. Literature excluded if they met the following criteria: (1) they were study design except RCT (2) had studies the effects of melatonin along with other interventions (3) had lack of sufficient data for the outcomes of interest in individuals and (4) studies carried out with less than 2 weeks follow-ups. Data extraction Two independent researchers (F. GH., N. R.) extracted the data for this meta-analysis, evaluated the quality of eligible studies, and performed double-checks.

Data extraction Two independent researchers (F. GH., N. R.) extracted the data for this meta-analysis, evaluated the quality of eligible studies, and performed double-checks. Any disagreements and differences were resolved by a third independent investi- gator (Kh-M), if necessary. The following data from the full text of selected studies were extracted: first authors name, year of publication, study location, study duration, gender, mean age and mean body mass index (BMI) of participants, study design, the health status of the study population, number of participants in each group, dose of melatonin supplementation and outcome results (means and standard deviations for PSQI before and after intervention). Statistical analysis The effect of melatonin on sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was estimated by pooling mean and standard deviation (SD) values of the baseline and the end of the studies in both intervention and control groups. If the studies did not report mean and SD, we used the following formula to calculate missing SDs for changes: SD change = square root [(SD baseline2 + SD final2)(2  R  SD baseline  SD final)]. We considered a correlation coefficient of 0.9 as the R-value of the men- tioned formula (18). Standard errors (SE) were converted to SD according to the formula of SE  n. If a study pro- vided medians (interquartile ranges), we converted them to means (SD) as described by Hozo and colleagues [19]. If the study results reported graphically, we used Get Data Graph Digitizer software to estimated mean (SD). At first, a fixed-effect model was performed to pool the data. The het- erogeneity was substantially significant when the Cochrane Q test showed a p value < 0.1 and I2 statistic provided the relative amount of variance of the summary effect. In case of heterogeneity, a random effects model by DerSimonian and Laird method [20] was applied.

Publica- tion bias was evaluated using Eggers regression test and Beggs rank correlation tests [21, 22]. Meta-analysis was carried out using Stata software, version 14 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Results Selected studies The initial search identified 2642 publications through Sco- pus, PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar. Then, we iden- tified 284 duplication records. After excluding duplicates, a total of 2358 studies were retrieved for title and abstract screening. After screening for title and abstract, 2324 arti- cles were excluded and 34 papers were retrieved for full text review. Out of 34 retrieved papers, 11 articles were excluded due to report different unit [12, 23, 24], without sufficient data [13, 25], complex intervention [2630] or overlapped by chosen studies [31]. Finally, 23 papers [3254] were eli- gible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. The flow chart of literature search is shown in Fig. 1. Quality assessment We used Cochrane scoring system to assess the quality of the included studies. The risk of bias is assessed by seven crite- ria which are as follows: random sequence generation, allo- cation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other biases. Studies were stratified as low risk of bias, high risk of bias or unclear regarding each criterion.

Details of risk of bias assessment are described in Table 1. Studies characteristics Eventually, we identified 23 trials that assessed the effects of melatonin on sleep quality. Included studies carried out in various countries such as Iran [32, 36, 37, 41, 52, 53], USA [50, 51], Denmark [49], Brazil [34, 44, 46], Korea [39], UK [40, 43, 47, 48], Mexico [47], South Korea [45], Singapore [38], Sri Lanka [35], Canada [33], Norway [42], Australia [54]. Publication dates ranged from 2004 and 2020. The follow-up period ranged from 2 to 24 weeks. The sample size of the included studies ranged from 16 to 711 participants. Some studies enrolled only males [32, 41] and females [34, 42, 5052] and the rest of included studies involved both genders [33, 3540, 4349, 53, 54]. Types of melatonin administration were melatonin [3238, 41, 42, 44, 46, 47, 5053] and Prolonged-release melatonin [39, 40, 43, 45, 48, 49, 54] among included studies.

The studies performed in subjects with different baseline BMI; six studies carried out in subjects under 25 kg/m2 [34, 36, 39, 41, 44, 45], nine studies over than 25 kg/m2 [32, 37, 40, 42, 48, 5154] and nine studies did not report BMI [33, 35, 38, 43, 46, 47, 49, 50]. 20 stud- ies were parallel randomized clinical trial and three studies were cross over randomized clinical trial.

Also, we observed that subgroup analysis based on kind of intervention (melatonin vs prolonged-release melatonin) were another source of heterogeneity, because heterogeneity decreased below 50%. Both of intervention improved sleep quality significantly [melatonin: (WMD:  1.52; 95% CI  2.34,  0.70, p = 0.000) and prolonged- release melatonin (WMD:  0.71; 95% CI  1.21,  0.21 p = 0.006)]. Subgroup analysis based on baseline BMI, dose of melatonin, study duration, age, and gender showed no significant differences between subgroups (Table 3). Sub- group analysis based on health status revealed that subjects with respiratory diseases (WMD:  2.20; 95% CI  2.97,  1.44, p = 0.000), metabolic disorders (WMD:  2.74; 95% CI  3.48,  2.00, p = 0.000) and sleep disorders ( WMD:  0.67; 95% CI  0.98,  0.37, p = 0.000) without significant heterogeneity and score of PSQI significantly decreased following melatonin supplementation; but there was not any significant effect in mental disorders (p = 0.648), neurodegenerative diseases (p = 0.132), and other disease (p = 0.224). Also, subgroup analysis revealed that both doses ( 3 mg and > 3 mg) decreased score of PSQI significantly [ 3 mg (WMD:  0.87; 95% CI  1.38, ", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 15693, "end_char": 17394}, {"chunk_id": "fatemeh2021effect_chunk_012", "source_id": "fatemeh2021effect", "text": "  0.98,  0.37, p = 0.000) without significant heterogeneity and score of PSQI significantly decreased following melatonin supplementation; but there was not any significant effect in mental disorders (p = 0.648), neurodegenerative diseases (p = 0.132), and other disease (p = 0.224).

Publication bias and sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis indicated that removing any of the studies could not substantially change the effect of melatonin on PSQI (Fig. 3). Assessment of publication bias by visual inspection of funnel plot indicated no evidence of publica- tion bias in the meta-analysis of melatonin intervention on sleep quality (Fig. 4). Eggers weighted regression tests also were performed to explore the publication bias. There was no evidence of publication bias for studies examining the effect of melatonin on PSQI (p = 0.293, Eggers test, and p = 0.882, Beggs test). Discussion In the current study, we proved a significant improvement in sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) by melatonin supplementation based on the random-effects model in adult populations. Some previous meta-analyses assess the effect of melatonin on sleep quality in special disease such as primary sleep disorders, secondary sleep disorder, chronic kidney diseases. Sleep disturbance (SD), unsatisfactory sleep, and altered sleep patterns are common among patients with various diseases which may result in decreasing quality of life. To the best of our knowl- edge, this study is the first meta-analysis that investigated the effect of melatonin on sleep quality as measured by the PSQI in adults with various diseases. However, there was evidence of between-study heterogeneity in this regard. We found participants health status was the potential source of heterogeneity. Based on subgroup analysis, there were sig- nificant effects of melatonin supplementation on sleep qual- ity in subjects with respiratory diseases, metabolic disorders, and sleep disorders, but in", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 16970, "end_char": 19184}, {"chunk_id": "fatemeh2021effect_chunk_013", "source_id": "fatemeh2021effect", "text": "actory sleep, and altered sleep patterns are common among patients with various diseases which may result in decreasing quality of life.

Based on subgroup analysis, there were sig- nificant effects of melatonin supplementation on sleep qual- ity in subjects with respiratory diseases, metabolic disorders, and sleep disorders, but in subjects with mental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, other diseases such as breast cancer, migraine, patients under MMT, alcohol use disorder, cirrhosis, IBS, brain injury, did not show any significant effect. Besides, we observed that subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention was another source of heterogeneity however, both interventions improved sleep quality signifi- cantly. Also, we found that both doses ( 3 mg and > 3 mg) increased sleep quality significantly. Melatonin is an important endogenous indoleamine that is synthesized and secreted into the systemic circulation and cerebrospinal fluid by the pineal gland. It has a substan- tial role to regulate the circadian rhythm and sleep during the night. It has also been suggested that melatonin may act to facilitate sleep by inhibiting the circadian drive for waking that comes from the suprachiasmatic nucleus [55]. 210 Journal of Neurology (2022) 269:205216 1 3 Table 2 Characteristics of included studies Author Country Year Study design Population Gender Sample size (inter- vention/ control) Mean age (interven- tion/control) Intervention Duration (weeks) Daily dose (mg) Study result Chen et al US 2014 Parallel Breast cancer Woman 39 41 59 59 Melatonin 16 3 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Kotlarczyk et al US 2012 Parallel Perimenopausal women Woman 13 5 50.3 47.5 Melatonin 24 3 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Gendy et al Canada 2020 Parallel Alcohol use disorder Mix 30 30 _ _ Melatonin 4 5 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Campos et al Brazil 2004 Parallel Asthma Woman 11 ", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 18511, "end_char": 20805}, {"chunk_id": "fatemeh2021effect_chunk_014", "source_id": "fatemeh2021effect", "text": " US 2014 Parallel Breast cancer Woman 39 41 59 59 Melatonin 16 3 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Kotlarczyk et al US 2012 Parallel Perimenopausal women Woman 13 5 50.3 47.5 Melatonin 24 3 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Gendy et al Canada 2020 Parallel Alcohol use disorder Mix 30 30 _ _ Melatonin 4 5 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Campos et al Brazil 2004 Parallel Asthma Woman 11 10 27 32.4 Melatonin 4 3 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score De Silva et al Sri Lanka 2020 Cross-over Cirrhosis Mix 37 34 63.6 60.1 Melatonin 4 3 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Halvani et al Iran 2013 Parallel COPD Mix 23 25 65.7 66.85 Melatonin 4 3 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Ostadmohammadi et al Iran 2019 Parallel Diabetic HD Mix 26 27 65.6 64.1 Melatonin 12 10 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Song et al Singapore 2005 Parallel IBS Mix 20 20 27.15 27.7 Melatonin 2 3 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Nunes et al Brazil 2008 Parallel COPD Mix 12 13 64.17 67.38 Melatonin 3 3 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Baandrup et al Denmark 2016 Parallel Schizophrenia or bipo- lar disorder Mix 28 27 48.8 49.1 PRM 24 2 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Shabania et al Iran 2018 Parallel PCOS Woman 29 29 26.5 26 Melatonin 12 10 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Mousavia et al Iran 2016 Parallel SM-injured patient Man 15 15 51.46 51.66 Melatonin 8 3 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Jun et al Korea 2018 Parallel RBD Mix 7 9 68.1 66.4 PRM 4 2 There was not", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 20367, "end_char": 22005}, {"chunk_id": "fatemeh2021effect_chunk_015", "source_id": "fatemeh2021effect", "text": "1 PRM 24 2 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Shabania et al Iran 2018 Parallel PCOS Woman 29 29 26.5 26 Melatonin 12 10 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Mousavia et al Iran 2016 Parallel SM-injured patient Man 15 15 51.46 51.66 Melatonin 8 3 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Jun et al Korea 2018 Parallel RBD Mix 7 9 68.1 66.4 PRM 4 2 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Jun et al Korea 2018 Parallel RBD Mix 9 9 64.7 66.4 PRM 4 6 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Wade et al UK 2007 Parallel Insomnia Mix 169 165 66.1 65.3 PRM 3 2 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Ghaderi et al Iran 2018 Parallel Patients under MMT Man 26 28 42.5 42.7 melatonin 12 10 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score Wade et al UK, USA 2014 Parallel Alzheimer Mix 31 29 75.3 75.3 PRM 24 2 There was not Significant reduction in PSQI score Medeiros et al Brazil 2006 Parallel Parkinson Mix 8 10 62.9 60.7 Melatonin 4 3 Significant reduction was observed in PSQI score 211 Journal of Neurology (2022) 269:205216 1 3 Melatonin levels decrease with age, so older adults are more prone to suffer from inadequate melatonin levels [56].

It has been recommended as the main measure for global sleep and insomnia symptoms in recent expert consensus recom- mendations for a standard set of research assessments in insomnia [57].

That should be noted that a higher PSQI score indicates a lower sleep quality. This review has focused on the effects of melatonin on sleep quality using the PSQI questionnaire in adult patients and showed that melatonin intervention can improve sleep quality. In line with our findings, Auld et al. [59] conducted a similar meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of melatonin in adult with primary sleep disorders. Although our analysis focused on subjects with any sleep disorders, Auld et al. revealed that exogenous melatonin reduces sleep onset latency in primary insomnia and DSPS and regulates the sleepwake patterns in blind patients. In another meta-analysis, Li et al. investigated the roles of melatonin supplementation for the treatment of secondary sleep disorders. Li et al.[14] demonstrated that melatonin improves sleep quality concerning sleep onset latency and total sleep time. However, Li et al. showed melatonin has no actions on the sleep efficiency of patients with secondary sleep disorders. Also, Zhang et al.[60] conducted a meta- analysis that investigated melatonin for sleep disorders in neurodegenerative disease and found melatonin improved sleep quality significantly, which is consistent with our results, but no significant effects were detected for objective sleep outcomes (total nocturnal sleep time (TNST), sleep efficiency, and the number of night-time awakenings). In contrast, a meta-analysis by Buscemi et al.[61] reported that melatonin supplementation in people who had sleep dis- orders with sleep restriction is not effective on sleep onset latency and found that melatonin has no effect in reliving sleep problems. Additionally, some randomized, placebo- controlled trials indicated that melatonin intervention cannot improve the quality of sleep [12, 13].

Also, some of the enrolled participants in two RCTs have already been experiencing _good_ sleep and some patients in these studies did not have insomnia, therefore, participants had heterogeneous symptoms of sleep disor- ders. However, an improvement in sleep quality was found in most of them. The etiology of sleep disorders is complex, involving multiple molecular mechanisms, so melatonin may be improving some aspect of sleep and it could be another reason for the lack of significant effect of melatonin in these subjects. Furthermore, some RCTs included in these subgroups had only a few participants, which may not be representa- tive of the large population afflicted by these sleep disor- ders. Besides, we observed that subgroup analysis based on kind of intervention (melatonin vs prolonged-release melatonin) could be another source of heterogeneity. Moreover, both melatonin and prolonged-release mela- tonin had a significant effect on sleep quality. Melatonin is tolerated well, unlike other sleeping medication melatonin has not high potential for dependence [62]. There is little evidence of substantial adverse events from long-term use of melatonin, and it can take many years for symptoms of toxicity to develop [63]. Using 20100 mg/day melatonin orally in healthy subjects has no significant side effects with no important alterations to any physiological or bio- chemical measures [64]. Some studies demonstrated that long-term use of melatonin is well tolerated, without any crucial side effect [31, 48, 65].

Most analyses had high levels of heterogeneity, but this is expected because included studies had participants with different health con- ditions or doses and duration. Additionally, there were not enough studies to evaluate sleep problems in some dis- eases. Moreover, our search was limited to published Eng- lish studies. Also, in this study, we used the PSQI global score to assess sleep quality, it seems that it is better to evaluate PSQI components separately.

This significant effect was also seen in subjects with respiratory diseases, metabolic dis- orders, and primary sleep disorders, but there was not any significant effect on mental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and other diseases.

Although sleep and depression relationships are well-studied, the relative impact of different sleep factors remains unclear. As patient-specific factors and health behaviors influence sleep and mental health, we investigated associations between sleep and depression severity considering such factors in a United States sample of adults. Methods: Two cycles (20112012, 20132014) from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey were studied. Objective sleep duration (day and night), and the sleep regularity index (SRI) were calculated from physical activity monitors worn for seven days. Complex survey procedures with four-year weights were used, and backward selection was used to test relevant variables in the fully adjusted regression model. Results: Among participants (n = 7297), we found associations between sleep-associated variables and SRI, with increased daytime sleep being the strongest correlate of decreased SRI. In the fully adjusted model, lower SRI scores and reduced subjective night sleep remained significantly associated with depression. Sex was an addi tional independent predictor, with females exhibiting higher depression scores, and a significant sex  SRI interaction revealed that the inverse relationship between SRI and depressive symptoms was stronger in females than in males. Health behaviors, including active tobacco and cannabis use, were also associated with increased depression severity in the adjusted model. Conclusions: Daytime sleep may serve as an SRI proxy, although additional cohorts should confirm relationships. Higher depression severity was associated with different sleep components, emphasizing the importance of sleep hygiene in mental health. Behaviors like current smoking and cannabis use were also associated with increased depression. Research exploring the temporality and interactions between these factors may assist in non- pharmacologic depression treatment. 1. Background Healthy sleep is a key determinant of overall health and disease prevention, with evidence supporting the role of sleep in maintaining physiological and psychological homeostasis (Li et al., 202", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 0, "end_char": 2831}, {"chunk_id": "maki2025sleep_chunk_002", "source_id": "maki2025sleep", "text": ", were also associated with increased depression severity in the adjusted model.

Background Healthy sleep is a key determinant of overall health and disease prevention, with evidence supporting the role of sleep in maintaining physiological and psychological homeostasis (Li et al., 2023; Lloyd- Jones et al., 2022). Adequate sleep duration, high-quality sleep, and consistent sleep and wake times are crucial for immune function, metabolic regulation, and cognitive performance (Sharma and Kavuru, 2010; Besedovsky et al., 2019; Van Dongen et al., 2003). Disrupted or insufficient sleep is linked to increased risks for chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and mental health disorders (Hale et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2024). Beyond duration, emerging research underscores the importance of sleep quality and regularity in achieving the full physiological and psychological benefits of sleep (Sletten et al., 2023). Sleep duration refers to the total time spent sleeping, sleep quality refers to the ease of initiation, maintenance, and restfulness, and sleep regularity refers to the consistency of sleep-wake cycles. While these factors are interrelated, each may have distinct ef fects on human health and particularly, mental health. Irregular sleep patterns, for example, can disrupt circadian rhythms and contribute to mood dysregulation, increasing the risk of depressive symptoms (Zee and Vitiello, 2009). Understanding the differential impact of these sleep dimensions on health, especially mental health, requires further research to guide effective interventions.

The Sleep Regularity Index (SRI), introduced in 2017, quantifies an individuals sleep/wake cycle consistency over time, by measuring the likelihood of being in the same state (asleep or awake) at two points separated by 24 h (Phillips et al., 2017). Research has associated the SRI with factors such as circadian misalignment (Phillips et al., 2017), academic performance (Phillips et al., 2017), cardiovascular risk (Lunsford-Avery et al., 2018), and self-reported depression severity (Lunsford-Avery et al., 2018). Lower SRI scores have also been linked to relapse and excessive daytime napping during inpatient treatment in individuals with alcohol use disorder (Barb et al., 2022; Brooks et al., 2020). Conversely, higher SRI scores, indicating more regular sleep and wake times, were associated with decreased mental exhaustion in the same population (Brooks et al., 2020).

Lower SRI scores have also been linked to relapse and excessive daytime napping during inpatient treatment in individuals with alcohol use disorder (Barb et al., 2022; Brooks et al., 2020). Conversely, higher SRI scores, indicating more regular sleep and wake times, were associated with decreased mental exhaustion in the same population (Brooks et al., 2020). Since its introduction, the SRI has garnered significant interest for its increasing association with health outcomes, and growing evidence supporting the protective effects of sleep regularity on mental health in specific populations like adolescents and early late life women (Swanson et al., 2023; Castiglione-Fontanellaz et al., 2023). Examining the relationship between SRI and self-reported depression severity in a nationally representative United States (U.S.) sample could enhance understanding of sleeps role in psychological well-being by validating previous research on SRI and mental health. Although the association between self-reported depression severity with sleep duration and sleep quality, respectively, has been well established, the relative contribution of these sleep characteristics as additive factors to depression severity remains unclear (Um et al., 2023; Scott et al., 2021). Epidemiological studies indicate that insufficient sleep duration is strongly linked to an increased risk of depression, with both short and excessively long sleep durations correlating with higher depression severity (Dong et al., 2022). Conversely, poor sleep quality is frequently reported by individuals with depression, complicating the understanding of the directional relationship between sleep distur bances and mental health symptoms (Edge, 2010; Riemann et al., 2020; Pearson et al., 2023). This bidirectional relationship between sleep disturbances and depression suggests that other factors may play a critical role in shaping both sleep patterns and mental health outcomes. Health behaviors and socioeconomic characteristics are increasingly recognized as pivotal factors that influence both sleep quality and mental health (Grandner et al., 2015). These factors, which include household income, employment status, physical activity, and diet (among others), profoundly shape individual sleep patterns and may exacerbate or mitigate mental health symptoms. Despite understanding the important role of sleep duration in influencing mental health char acteristics (Zhang et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024; Nielson et al., 2023), further research is needed to explore how environmental, behavioral, and other sleep-related factors impact self", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 5535, "end_char": 8205}, {"chunk_id": "maki2025sleep_chunk_005", "source_id": "maki2025sleep", "text": " outcomes.

Un derstanding these interactions is crucial for identifying modifiable health behaviors that may present valuable opportunities for developing targeted interventions to improve depressive symptom severity. Eluci dating such mechanisms will enable us to understand which components of sleep phenotype contribute to depression and provide us with a comprehensive overview of the influence of sleep health on mental health. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate associations between sleep characteristics (i.e., regularity, duration) and self-reported depression severity considering relevant demographic, health behavior and socioeconomic characteristics in a nationally representative U.S. Sample using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 20112014. 2. Methods 2.1. Study sample The NHANES is a cross-sectional, nationally representative health and nutrition survey designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the U.S. through a combination of interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory tests (Chen et al., 2018). The NHANES survey is administered by the National Center for Health Sta tistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the survey uses a complex, multistage probability sampling design to ensure that its data are representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. popu lation (Johnson et al., 2013). This study includes two cycles of NHANES data (20112012, 20132014), which are the two NHANES cycles where physical activity monitors were applied and actigraphy data was collected for objective sleep assessment (National Center for Health Statistics, 2012; National Center for Health Statistics, 2014a). Of the 15, 179 participants included in these two NHANES cycles, subjects 18 years of age and older with self-reported depression severity instrument data, and no psychotropic medication use were considered for analysis.

This study includes two cycles of NHANES data (20112012, 20132014), which are the two NHANES cycles where physical activity monitors were applied and actigraphy data was collected for objective sleep assessment (National Center for Health Statistics, 2012; National Center for Health Statistics, 2014a). Of the 15, 179 participants included in these two NHANES cycles, subjects 18 years of age and older with self-reported depression severity instrument data, and no psychotropic medication use were considered for analysis. The final study sample included 7297 participants (see Fig. 1). 2.2. Demographic variables Participants age and sex were obtained from the NHANES De mographic Variables Questionnaire, and body mass index (BMI) from examination data (Body Measures). Race/ethnicity was determined from NHANES Demographics variable RIDRETH3 and included Non- Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Asian, Multi- Racial and Mexican American and Other Hispanic categories were combined to a recoded variable Mexican American/Other Hispanic, and other categories were unchanged. 2.3. Socioeconomic characteristics Income/Poverty Ratio: The income/poverty ratio was obtained from NHANES variable INDFMPIR - ratio of family income to poverty and recoded where 01.30 = lowest, 1.311.85 = middle, and 1.86-max = highest based from cut off points consistent with those used to determine eligibility of food assistance programs and other analyses of National data (Nord, 2010). Current Employment: Current employment was determined from the NHANES variable OCD150 - Type of work done last week, where an answer of Working at a job or business was coded as yes (currently working) and all other answers were coded as no (not currently working). Full or part-time work was not specified in the model. 2.4. Health behavior variables Sedentary Time: Sedentary behaviors on a typical day were derived from the Physical Activity Survey (PAQ_H). Patients were asked to approximate how many minutes they spent sitting on a typical day (not including sleeping) and sedentary time was analyzed as a continuous variable of average minutes/day. Diet Quality: The Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) was used for diet quality assessment.

A HEI-2015 per person score was calculated from the two 24-h recalls (Krebs-Smith et al., 2018). The updated HEI-2015 was used due to its inclusion of added sugars in total score calculation, and presence in recent health guidelines that also measure sleep as a health predictor component (Lloyd-Jones et al., 2022; Krebs-Smith et al., 2018). Cannabis Use in Previous 14 Days: Cannabis use in the past 14 days was quantified using variables from the Drug Use Survey (DUQ_H). All responses from the questions inquiring about the last time the partici pant used marijuana or hashish were recorded to days and if days 14, Active cannabis use = Yes; if last use >14 days, Active cannabis use = No. A period of 14 days was selected to correspond with the time in which symptoms of depression are evaluated in the PHQ-9. Current Tobacco Smoking: Active smoking status was quantified using variables from the Smoking - Cigarette Use Survey (SMQ_H).

If patients had not smoked at least 100 cigarettes in life and/or answered they do not currently smoke cigarettes, Smoking = No; if SMQ040 = Every day or Some days, Smoking = Yes. 2.5. Psychotropic medication use Previous research demonstrates that self-reported mental health outcome measures are influenced from active psychotropic medication use (Busgang et al., 2022; Valles-Colomer et al., 2019), and relationships between sleep and mental health symptom severity may be confounded by these medications. Therefore, psychotropic medications (i.e., anti depressant, antimanic, and anxiolytic medication classes) were classi fied according to Lexicon Plus, and participants reporting psychotropic medication use were excluded from the current analysis. See Supple mental Methods for medication classes included in our classification of psychotropic medications and respective coding syntax. 2.6. Self-reported depression severity Symptoms of depression were quantified using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), which is a nine-item screening instrument that asked questions about the frequency of symptoms of depression over the past 14 days (Kroenke et al., 2001). PHQ-9 data was collected in par ticipants aged 12 years and older, but as scores are restricted in par ticipants aged 1217, participants aged 18 and older were included in this present analysis. Additionally, participants requiring a proxy did not have the PHQ-9 questionnaire performed due to the sensitive nature of the questions. Each item on the measure is rated on a 4-point scale (0 = Not at all; 1 = Several days; 2 = More than half the days; and 3 = Nearly every day), and the total score can range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms. Depression severity was evaluated using both continuous values and categorical grouping of depression severity levels to none (scores 04), mild depression (scores 59), moderate depression (scores 1014), moderately severe depression (scores 1519),", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 13057, "end_char": 15479}, {"chunk_id": "maki2025sleep_chunk_009", "source_id": "maki2025sleep", "text": " the PHQ-9 questionnaire performed due to the sensitive nature of the questions.

Objective sleep variables For NHANES 20112014, participants were asked to wear a physical activity monitor (ActiGraph model GT3X+, manufactured by ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL) on their wrist. The physical activity monitor was placed on the examination day in the NHANES Mobile Examination Center. Patients were instructed to keep wearing the device all day and night for seven full days (midnight to midnight) and remove it on the morning of the ninth day. The monitor continuously recorded triaxial accelerometry at 80 Hz sampling intervals, and monitor-independent movement sum mary units were used for accelerometer data processing (John et al., 2019). For detailed data collection, processing, quality control, and participant status characterization procedures, please see (National Center for Health Statistics, 2012; National Center for Health Statistics, 2014a; John et al., 2019). In brief, raw accelerometry data were compiled and underwent quality review/annotation, and monitor-independent movement summary units were subsequently independently calculated. An open-source machine learning algorithm was used for prediction of wake, sleep, or non-wear status for each minute using three-step process. First, prediction values and confidence intervals were calculated over each 30-s epoch from the monitor-independent movement summary units, and then in a second pass, minimum durations and predictive confidence values were considered in the periods before and after each segment undergoing evaluation (National Center for Health Statistics, 2012; National Center for Health Statistics, 2014a). Finally, longer periods were scanned to specifically consider orientation changes characteristic of physiologic sleep to generate a final determination of sleep, wake, or non-wear during each corresponding minute when data met duration and qual ity thresholds (National Center for Health Statistics, 2012; National Center for Health Statistics, 2014a). Actigraphy data were retained for our objective sleep analysis only for participants who provided at least seven valid monitoring days, with no more than one of those days containing two or more hours of invalid (excluded) epochs.

Sleep Regularity Index: Objective sleep data were collected and assessed using actigraphy data from the activity watch monitor as above. Raw actigraphy files named as physical activity monitor were down loaded from the 20112012 and 20132014 NHANES cycles. The SRI was calculated using a script in the JMP version 16 statistical discovery software (version 16, Cary, NC) adapted from a previously published SRI python script (https://github.com/mengelhard/sri). (Phillips et al., 2017) The SRI is described as the average percent that a person is either asleep or awake at the same time in a 24-h period over a given interval of time (i.e., days, weeks or months). For the current analysis, a re spondents actigraphy data was included if the wearable device pro duced data for the entirety of seven 24-h days. A respondent was not included in the analysis if there was more than one day with two or more hours of excluded data in line with previous recommendations for valid SRI calculation (Lunsford-Avery et al., 2018). Excluded data can result from a watch malfunction or non-wear. Epochs for this device are recorded as 1-min intervals with a total of 1440 epochs for each 24-h period. Actigraphy data were considered starting at 21:31 on Day 1 (examination day in the NHANES Mobile Examination Center) and were evaluated through 21:30 on Day 8 for a goal of 7 replicates of 24-h complete actigraphy data. After filtering for relevant actigraphy data, a total of 2830 respondents were excluded from the analysis of objective sleep parameters including SRI. Day and Night Sleep Duration: Objective sleep duration was calcu lated using the day interval as data collected between 9:31 a.m.9:30 p. m. and night intervals from 9:31 p.m.9:30 a.m. Predicted sleep state values were summarized with day sleep duration including sleep that", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 18512, "end_char": 20792}, {"chunk_id": "maki2025sleep_chunk_012", "source_id": "maki2025sleep", "text": " Mobile Examination Center) and were evaluated through 21:30 on Day 8 for a goal of 7 replicates of 24-h complete actigraphy data.

Statistical analyses Analyses were performed in SAS, SPSS and JMP (v16.0; SAS Head quarters, Cary, NC). Complex survey procedures with four-year sample weights were used in SAS to account for the NHANES complex sample design. Means, proportions, and standard errors (SE) were used to describe the overall sample and depression severity groups (from proc surverymeans and proc surveyfreq procedures). The SAS survey pro cedures Surveyreg and the SurveyCorrCov macro were used for descriptive, bivariate, and regression analyses to assess the association between depression, sleep-associated variables, patient specific vari ables, and health behavior variables (https://github.com/DavidRNelso n/-surveycorrcov-sas-macro) (Nelson et al., 2020). Backward selection with p < .1 was used to choose variables for the final model. Sensitivity analyses using interaction terms on the fully adjusted survey-weighted model were conducted to evaluate interactions between SRI and sig nificant predictors hypothesized to influence both SRI and depression including sex, family income/poverty ratio, current smoking and cannabis use within the past 14 days.

Discussion In this study, we explored the influence of sleep characteristics, such as sleep regularity and duration, on self-reported depression severity, while accounting for relevant demographic, socioeconomic and health behavior covariates. In a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, we demonstrate that multiple factors, including sleep health, working status, income/poverty ratio, and active tobacco and cannabis use, in fluence depression severity. For example, indicators of sleep time and quality are significant predictors of self-reported depression severity including sleep regularity and subjective nighttime sleep. After con trolling for all relevant variables, not currently working was associated with higher depression levels, while a higher income/poverty ratio was linked to lower depression levels. Current tobacco and cannabis use were also significant predictors of higher depression severity. These results extend existing research supporting relationships between sleep and mental health, highlighting the importance of including health be haviors and patient-specific factors when evaluating depression risk. This analysis supports and contributes to the current literature on the associations between both objective and subjective sleep indices and mental health behaviors, particularly regarding the link between sleep regularity and depression.

This analysis supports and contributes to the current literature on the associations between both objective and subjective sleep indices and mental health behaviors, particularly regarding the link between sleep regularity and depression. Notably, our results are consistent with one of the pioneer validation studies of the SRI which found that higher sleep irregularity was associated with elevated depressive symptom severity, along with other mental health symptoms such as increased perceived stress (Lunsford-Avery et al., 2018). Our analysis highlights the impor tance of considering multiple sleep components of sleep hygiene (i.e., day and nighttime duration and sleep regularity), in relation to depression. Additionally, a recent study has shown a strong association between sleep irregularity and symptoms of depression and anxiety among women (Swanson et al., 2023). In our analysis, women reported higher depression severity than men overall, and the significant female  SRI interaction demonstrated that women with lower SRI scores experienced higher depressive symptoms compared to men with simi larly low SRI scores in alignment with these prior results. This suggests that although women may experience more severe depression, there is also a stronger relationship between sleep regularity and depression severity in women than in men. Therefore, women may experience greater reductions in depressive symptoms from sleep timing in terventions, which highlights the importance of developing gender-specific sleep treatments for depression alongside other health behavior interventions, although our results should be further tested in validation and interventional studies. This analysis further emphasizes the importance of evaluating and quantifying various health behaviors when exploring relationships be tween sleep and depressive symptoms. Previous research based on NHANES survey data has shown that both tobacco and cannabis use are associated with depression (Gorfinkel et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2023). Our current study supports these findings, revealing a positive relationship between active cannabis use in the prior 14 days and PHQ-9 scores. While cannabis use has been linked to higher levels of depression (Langlois et al., 2021), as well as alterations in sleep architecture during active use and periods of abstinence and/or withdrawal, self-reported depression severity has been identified as a mediator between cannabis use and poor sleep quality (Maple", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 31437, "end_char": 34381}, {"chunk_id": "maki2025sleep_chunk_021", "source_id": "maki2025sleep", "text": " research based on NHANES survey data has shown that both tobacco and cannabis use are associated with depression (Gorfinkel et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2023). Our current study supports these findings, revealing a positive relationship between active cannabis use in the prior 14 days and PHQ-9 scores. While cannabis use has been linked to higher levels of depression (Langlois et al., 2021), as well as alterations in sleep architecture during active use and periods of abstinence and/or withdrawal, self-reported depression severity has been identified as a mediator between cannabis use and poor sleep quality (Maple et al., 2016). This suggests a potential bidirectional relationship between sleep quality and depres sion severity. Furthermore, the endocannabinoid system, which plays a crucial role in regulating mood, sleep, and stress responses, has been implicated in both sleep quality and depression (Graczyk et al., 2021; Babson et al., 2017). However, due to the complex interactions between cannabis use, endocannabinoid signaling, and mental health, the rela tionship between these factors and their impact on sleep and depression warrants further investigation. Although we could not control for alcohol use in our present study, previous work by our group showed a relationship in people with alcohol use disorder (AUD) who recently completed inpatient treatment between SRI scores and relapse status (Barb et al., 2022). Moreover, another study from our group demon strated a relationship of lower SRI scores with excessive daytime nap ping in people with AUD during inpatient treatment (Brooks et al., 2020). In this study sample, we also noted a strong inverse correlation between average daytime sleep and SRI, which underscores that nap ping behavior may be a major driver of sleep irregularity. However, the SRI is a multidimensional construct which is calculated as the proba bility of being in the same sleep or wake state at any two time-points 24 h apart. Therefore, in addition to timing, frequency and duration of daytime naps, SRI also captures variability in night-to-night sleep and wake times, shifts in the midpoint of the main sleep period, and frag mentation and wake within sleep episodes (Phillips et al., 2017; Luns ford-Avery et al., 2018; Fischer et al., 2021). Relying on daytime sleep alone therefore risks misclassifying individuals who keep highly irreg ", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 33763, "end_char": 36160}, {"chunk_id": "maki2025sleep_chunk_022", "source_id": "maki2025sleep", "text": " multidimensional construct which is calculated as the proba bility of being in the same sleep or wake state at any two time-points 24 h apart.

Relying on daytime sleep alone therefore risks misclassifying individuals who keep highly irreg ular sleep schedules but rarely nap (leading to lower SRI scores) or have highly regulated nap and sleep schedules (leading to higher SRI scores). Future studies testing self-reported measures that combine questions on daytime sleep and napping behaviors with items on sleep- and wake-time variability may provide insight to the extent daytime napping correlates across different patient and occupational populations (i.e., shift workers). Building on our observation that lower SRI scores track with self-reported depression severity, future studies should replicate these analyses in diverse clinical and community cohorts to determine how much SRI contributes to mental health across patient populations. The association between patient-specific factors, such as current work status, and depression has been noted to be complex and may depend on ones community or other psychological factors. For example, many studies have reported the protective benefits of employment on an individuals mental health and unstable work contributing to higher depression severity (Oh et al., 2022; Li and Chu, 2024). Other research has linked occupational hazards, such as employee burnout, to increased subjective stress and depression (Kottler et al., 2024; Ryan et al., 2023). Nevertheless, although these data only captured work status over the previous week, our findings support previous research and the re lationships between employment and depressive symptoms such that, participants who reported no work in the previous week had higher depressive symptoms when all other factors were held constant. Several strengths of our study enabled us to gather important data, including both objective and subjective assessments of sleep, and a comprehensive nationally representative database with clinically rele vant variables, such as PHQ-9, health behaviors, and socioeconomic variables. However, there are limitations that are important to acknowledge.

However, there are limitations that are important to acknowledge. First, although prior research from our group demon strated associations with the SRI in various clinical measures and alcohol use related variables in people with AUD (Barb et al., 2022), we did not include alcohol use in this analysis. We were unable to include this information in our analysis as the timeframe of the alcohol related surveys cover intake over the previous 12 months, and therefore would not be concordant with the timeframe captured in the current study. Second, patient-reported depression severity and actigraphy measures K.A. Maki et al. Neurobiology of Sleep and Circadian Rhythms 19 (2025) 100133 6 were not evaluated over the same timeframe. Actigraphy watches were placed during the in-person assessment and monitored for the following seven days of sleep and wake, while the PHQ-9 questionnaire assessed self-reported depression severity in the 14 days preceding the examina tion. We therefore had to assume that sleep behaviors in the post-visit week resembled sleep during the two-week period before the clinical assessment when depression severity was assessed. Such temporal mismatch may misclassify exposure or outcome variables and weaken the observed within-person associations. In addition, the cross-sectional design prevents causal inference in terms of whether irregular sleep contributes to mood disturbance or whether depression severity impacts sleep patterns (i.e., people with higher depression severity experience greater sleep irregularity and daytime napping secondary to their symptom presentation). Longitudinal studies that capture sleep and mood concurrently are needed to validate our findings and clarify directionality. Until such evidence is available, any recommendations must be considered hypothesis-generating and used to inform future clinically relevant research probing relationships between sleep and mental health. Third, limitations inherent to actigraphy must be considered. Actigraphy estimates sleep based on movement, which may lead to misclassification, particularly in individuals who experience prolonged periods of inactivity while awake. Additionally, best practices for sleep regularity assessment recommend using sleep diaries alongside actig raphy to enhance accuracy (Lunsford-Avery et al., 2018).

Actigraphy estimates sleep based on movement, which may lead to misclassification, particularly in individuals who experience prolonged periods of inactivity while awake. Additionally, best practices for sleep regularity assessment recommend using sleep diaries alongside actig raphy to enhance accuracy (Lunsford-Avery et al., 2018). However, NHANES did not include subjective daily sleep logs to accompany actigraphy measures, limiting our ability to validate objective sleep regularity measurements outside of the comprehensive information on data quality review and open-source prediction algorithms published on the NHANES website (National Center for Health Statistics, 2014a; National Center for Health Statistics, 2014b). The timeframe of actig raphy collection in the NHANES sample was limited to 79 days and some data loss (i.e., individual respondents were excluded) was un avoidable due to respondents not wearing the watch devices for extended periods of time. This limited the total sample size with an adequate amount of physical activity monitor data meeting quality thresholds to be assessed for objective sleep measures and SRI. A com parison of respondents with versus without useable actigraphy revealed differences across groups: non-included participants were younger, more likely to be employed, and had slightly poorer diet quality. This pattern suggests a potential selection bias, whereby groups with greater competing time demands or unhealthy lifestyle behaviors were under-represented in the objective sleep analyses, possibly leading to conservative estimates of associations between sleep and mental health. Because these characteristics may also influence willingness or ability to wear actigraphy devices, our findings underscore the need for dedicated feasibility work. Future studies should explicitly assess actigraphy acceptability and adherence among younger, full-time workers, and adapt monitoring protocols (e.g., flexible wear schedules, real-time adherence prompts) to ensure these groups are adequately captured. Finally, the self-reported sleep duration variable in NHANES was limited in scope. Due to the question wording (i.e., How much sleep do you usually get at night on weekdays or workdays?), participants only commented on average nighttime sleep on weekdays or workdays, which does not account for factors that may influence SRI across the entire week. For example, daytime napping behaviors or extended sleep on weekends to compensate for decreased weekday sleep due to school- related or occupational", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 39719, "end_char": 42603}, {"chunk_id": "maki2025sleep_chunk_025", "source_id": "maki2025sleep", "text": " adherence among younger, full-time workers, and adapt monitoring protocols (e.g., flexible wear schedules, real-time adherence prompts) to ensure these groups are adequately captured.

For example, daytime napping behaviors or extended sleep on weekends to compensate for decreased weekday sleep due to school- related or occupational factors may have resulted in an underestimation of perceived average sleep duration. Furthermore, as NHANES only inquired about night sleep and did not assess daytime sleep, participants with increased hours of sleep during the day due to shift work or other factors may have further underestimated total sleep duration, suggesting future validation of objective and subjective sleep variables should consider subjective evaluation of daytime and weekend sleep behaviors. Despite these limitations, our study identified significant associations between lower sleep regularity, shorter sleep duration, and increased depression severity, even after adjusting for key health behaviors and socioeconomic factors. These findings highlight the importance of sleep consistency in mental health and suggest that future research investi gating the efficacy of interventions targeting sleep regularity may be beneficial for mitigating depression risk. 5. Conclusions In this nationally representative samples of U.S. adults, lower SRI and shorter reported nighttime sleep duration remained significantly associated with increased self-reported depression severity, even after adjusting for clinically relevant factors. Given the strong correlation between average daytime sleep and SRI, daytime sleep patterns may serve as a pragmatic, although partial, proxy for assessing sleep regu larity in the absence of actigraphy. Future studies are needed to test the sensitivity and specificity of relationships between daytime napping and SRI across clinical and occupational populations to determine its generalizability. Additionally, women had stronger relationships be tween SRI and depression severity and sleep hygiene represents a modifiable risk factor that could be targeted in managing depression severity in women. Given SRI was an independent predictor of depres sion severity, our results highlight the potential importance of sleep regularity in promoting mental health in both women and men and highlight the need for continued research on behavioral interventions aimed at improving sleep consistency as a non-pharmacologic approach to mitigating depression symptoms. In addition to optimizing sleep, targeting health behaviors such as smoking cessation and decreasing cannabis use will aid in the ongoing management of depressive symp toms", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 41919, "end_char": 44944}, {"chunk_id": "maki2025sleep_chunk_026", "source_id": "maki2025sleep", "text": " determine its generalizability.

Design: A blinded, randomized split-plot experimental study. Setting: Two urban academic clinical centers. Participants: 107 participants (68% female, mean age 42  11) with major depressive disorder and insomnia. Interventions: Randomization was to one of three groups: antidepressant (AD; escitalopram) + CBT-I (4 sessions), CBT-I + placebo pill, or AD + 4-session sleep hygiene control (SH). Measurements and Results: Subjective sleep was assessed via 2 weeks of daily sleep diaries (use of medication was covaried in all analyses); although there were no statistically significant group differences detected, all groups improved from baseline to posttreatment on subjective sleep efficiency (SE) and total wake time (TWT) and the effect sizes were large. Objective sleep was assessed via overnight polysomnographic monitoring at baseline and posttreatment; anal- yses revealed both CBT groups improved on TWT (p = .03), but the AD + SH group worsened. There was no statistically significant effect for PSG SE (p = .07). There was a between groups medium effect observed for the AD + SH and CBT + placebo group differences on diary TWT and both PSG variables.

Conclusions: Although all groups self-reported sleeping better after treatment, only the CBT-I groups improved on objective sleep, and AD + SHs sleep worsened. This suggests that we should be treating sleep in those with depression with an effective insomnia treatment and relying on self-report obscures sleep worsening effects. All groups improved on depression, even a group with absolutely no depression-focused treatment component (CBT-I + placebo). The depression effect in CBT-I only group has been reported in other studies, suggesting that we should further investigate the antidepressant properties of CBT-I. Keywords: insomnia, depression, CBT-I. INTRODUCTION Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a condition with markedly reduced quality of life, increased health-care utilization and suicide risk, and impaired social/occupational functioning.13 Antidepressant medications (for review see4) and psychologi- cal interventions (for review see5) have well-established effi- cacy for treating MDD and restoring normal functioning in many with this condition. However, those MDD patients who present with clinically significant insomnia complaints com- prise a particularly challenging group to treat. For many such patients, insomnia represents a long-standing and problematic condition that can: (1) predate the onset of MDD,6,7 (2) increase the risk of suicide,8,9 (3) show a suboptimal response to tra- ditional depression treatment,10,11 (4) remain after successful depression treatment,12,13 and (5) increase risk for MDD relapse (e.g., Nierenberg et al14). Perhaps because the insomnia of MDD patients traditionally has been viewed as an MDD symp- tom rather than a comorbid disorder, the sleep-specific treat- ment needs of MDD patients have been largely ignored until recently. Addressing this gap in the literature is important when the prevalence of MDD and sleep complaints are considered; 90% of those in clinical settings presenting with MDD com- plain of sleep problems,15", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 1598, "end_char": 4042}, {"chunk_id": "carney2017cognitive_chunk_003", "source_id": "carney2017cognitive", "text": " ditional depression treatment,10,11 (4) remain after successful depression treatment,12,13 and (5) increase risk for MDD relapse (e.g., Nierenberg et al14). Perhaps because the insomnia of MDD patients traditionally has been viewed as an MDD symp- tom rather than a comorbid disorder, the sleep-specific treat- ment needs of MDD patients have been largely ignored until recently. Addressing this gap in the literature is important when the prevalence of MDD and sleep complaints are considered; 90% of those in clinical settings presenting with MDD com- plain of sleep problems,15,16 and MDD plus insomnia patients actually outnumber insomnia-only patients in sleep clinics by almost 2:1.1719 Considering the persistence and potential long- term significance that insomnia may have for MDD patients, well-designed studies to test the benefits of insomnia-targeted therapies for those who present comorbid MDD and insomnia are urgently needed. Of the available treatments, Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) represents an attractive option for comorbid MDD/insomnia patients. CBT-I is currently considered a safe, efficacious, and durable therapy for the treatment of insomnia disorder (ID).20 Studies suggest that the psychological factors targeted by CBT-I presumed to perpetuate the sleep problems among ID sufferers generally are also common in insomnia patients with comorbid depression.12,21 In addition, CBT-I has been shown to successfully reduce these sleep-disruptive factors and to improve the sleep of patients with insomnia and comor- bid mental disorders, even in those receiving pharmacotherapy for depression.22 One study evaluating CBT-I for those with residual MDD and refractory insomnia after adequate pharma- cotherapy for depression found that both sleep and depression improved significantly more among the CBT-I group than those treated as usual with only pharmacotherapy.23 Furthermore, research suggests that significant improvements in sleep are associated with mood improvements and even remission of the depressive episode.2426 Taken together, these studies provide convincing early evi- dence that CBT-I is effective for improvement in sleep and may also lead to additional improvement in depression symp- toms. Unfortunately, the studies conducted to date lacked both proper control groups and objective (polysomnography [PSG]) verification of sleep changes. An exploration of PSG-measured sleep is important because we know that antidepressants can cause objective sleep problems (for review see27).

SLEEP, Vol. 40, No. 4, 2017 MDD. It was hypothesized that (1) the combined CBT-I + AD therapy would produce significantly greater pre-to-post ther- apy improvements on subjective and objective sleep continuity measures than the two monotherapy conditions; (2) the com- bined CBT-I + AD therapy would produce significantly greater pre- to posttherapy improvements in clinician-assessed depres- sion (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAMD-17]); and (3) posttreatment sleep would predict posttreatment depression symptoms. METHODS Design This trial employed a randomized split-plot experimental design with three between-group cells (CBT-I + AD, CBT-I + PD, and AD + SH) and four within-group cells (baseline, mid-treatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up).

Participants Men and women aged 1864 years old meeting diagnostic cri- teria for both MDD and ID were recruited via clinics and media advertisements. The advertisements invited participation in a study for depression and insomnia and did not reveal study hypotheses. Recruitment took place at two study sites: Duke University in North Carolina from 2008 to 2009 and Ryerson University in Toronto, Canada, from 2009 to 2014. Study pro- tocols were approved by both Duke University and Ryerson University ethics review boards, and all participants provided written consent for participation.

Treatments The therapists were novice graduate students naive to sleep treatments. They were masters-level students with at least 1 year of practicum training in other CBTs. They were trained by the principal investigator (PI)/author of the standardized treatment protocols (CBT-I and SH) published elsewhere.28 New therapists began by observing at least two therapy ses- sions by a doctoral-level student, and they proceeded to tak- ing the lead in cotherapy with a doctoral-level student in the room. Once the doctoral-level student and the supervising PI/ first author agreed the student was competent in the therapy, the therapist was approved for therapy alone but under the weekly supervision of the PI (i.e., a behavioral medicine specializing in CBT for comorbid insomnia). There was no formal competence evaluation beyond observation and supervision. Participants were randomized to one of three groups; all received 8 weeks of active treatment delivered in four biweekly sessions: (1) CBT-I + AD; (2) CBT-I + PD; (3) AD + SH (sleep hygiene control). Double-blinding procedures were accomplished through a com- pounding pharmacy that was responsible for receiving partici- pant group information from one study administrator who was not blinded to treatment group.

In fact, patients with depression and an insomnia com- plaint report greater subjective sleep improvement with escit- alopram than with placebo,30 and escitalopram has extremely low rates of adverse drug effects that lead to discontinuing medication and/or initiating a new or additional therapy, so it seemed a good choice. Escitalopram is currently one of the most frequently prescribed medications, perhaps due to its rat- ing as one of the most cost-effective SSRIs.29,31,32 Adherence to the placebo and escitalopram medications was verified at each physician appointment with pill counts. CBT-I + AD Participants in this treatment group received CBT-I and the antidepressant, escitalopram. As part of the CBT-I treatment, patients were first presented a standardized animated Powerpoint presentation containing sleep education and information relat- ing to CBT for insomnia based on materials from Edinger and Carney.28 This education is designed to address unhelpful beliefs about sleep by providing corrective information about sleep (e.g., age-appropriate sleep norms, the effects of aging on sleep, influ- ence of circadian rhythms, and the effects of sleep deprivation). During the remainder of the session, patients were provided a regimen instructing them to (a) establish a standard wake time; (b) get out of bed whenever awake for >20 minutes; (c) avoid reading, watching television, eating, worrying, or other sleep-in- compatible behaviors in the bed or bedroom; (d) refrain from day- time napping; and (e) limit their total time in bed (T", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 12543, "end_char": 14864}, {"chunk_id": "carney2017cognitive_chunk_009", "source_id": "carney2017cognitive", "text": " sleep by providing corrective information about sleep (e.g., age-appropriate sleep norms, the effects of aging on sleep, influ- ence of circadian rhythms, and the effects of sleep deprivation).

The remain- ing three treatment sessions were used to reinforce instructions provided in the first session and to make needed adjustments in TIB prescriptions. The TIB was increased by 15-min increments when the SE was >85%, and there was a report of daytime sleep- iness. TIB was decreased by 15-min increments each week the subject showed an average SE <80%. Further, in sessions 24, remaining sleep-interfering beliefs were targeted by designing/ conducting behavioral experiments (e.g., testing the belief that, I have limited resources to cope with daytime symptoms, or that, I need to try to sleep). There were four 1-hr CBT-I biweekly sessions (treatment phase is thus 8 weeks). A biweekly four-ses- sion schedule was selected because it has been shown empirically to be the optimal dose/schedule.61 Participants assigned to this condition also received a 10-mg daily dose of the medication, escitalopram, and they were maintained on this dose throughout the trial as there are no data supporting greater efficacy at a higher dose than 10 mg. The study physician met with each participant in this condition weekly to provide medication instructions and to assess and monitor adverse events; an MD research assistant blinded to conditions and trained in HAMD17 administration completed the HAMD17 ratings. During the first visit, the physician gave the participant an 8-week supply of escitalopram and instructed them to take one dose of this medication (i.e., a single 10-mg pill) each morning throughout the trial.

Those who responded (i.e., had a > 50% decrease on HAMD17 and a > 50% decrease in ISI from baseline) did not meet current criteria for MDD, evidenced no significant adverse medication effects, and had HAMD17 and ISI scores <15 con- tinued on their medication into the 6-month follow-up period or until they met removal criteria. CBT-I + PD medication Participants assigned to the CBT-I + PD treatment group received the same CBT-I treatment described earlier but were given the inactive placebo in place of the escitalopram. The pla- cebo medication condition was used to control for the effects of pill taking that are operative in the CBT-I + AD and AD + SH groups. Participants received the same instructions as the escitalopram (e.g., a single pill is to be taken each morning) and underwent the same adverse event assessment and weekly HAMD17 as the CBT-I + AD group. AD + SH Participants assigned to the AD + SH group received the same medication (10 mg escitalopram), and weekly physician-di- rected adverse event assessments and research assistant-admin- istered HAMD17 as the AD + CBT-I condition. However, they received generic sleep hygiene instructions instead of an active cognitive behavioral sleep treatment (e.g., CBT-I). Preliminary studies support the perceived credibility of SH as an insomnia treatment. Also, SH recommendations have good face validity, as they are often used in clinical practice. Nonetheless, sleep hygiene recommendations are ineffective for treating insomnia when used in the absence of other insomnia therapies.33,34 In the current trial, each participant assigned to this condition received the SH intervention during 4 biweekly 1-hr individual therapy sessions with a study therapist.

During the first SH session, the therapist reviewed the patients sleep diaries without sugges- tions for altering the observed sleep schedule. SH consisted of descriptions of sleep stages, normal sleep architecture, and sleep cycles presented via an animated Powerpoint presenta- tion. After presenting this educational information, the therapist discussed a series of recommendations from the manual enti- tled Overcoming Insomnia,28 including eliminating caffeine and alcohol, avoiding exercise and other physical activity just prior to bed, having a light snack before bed, and keeping the bedroom quiet, dark, and at a comfortable temperature. These recommendations were applied to the participants own circum- stances in detail, such as planning a particular sleep-inducing snack (e.g., milk, peanut butter, and crackers) or not scheduling exercise right before bed. In addition to receiving these verbal instructions, SH patients were given a take-home pamphlet reit- erating the sleep hygiene instructions. During subsequent SH sessions, the therapist reviewed the logs and the sleep hygiene recommendations and addressed treatment adherence problems.

It contains items that assess orientation, attention, memory skills, mathematical abili- ties, and language skills. Following standard administration and scoring procedures, all individuals who obtained a total MMSE score <27 were excluded. Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders The Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID)38 was used to identify study candidates who met DSM-IV-TR inclusion criteria for MDD as part of the screening process and to identify patients who met criteria for a major psychiatric illness other than MDD (e.g., particu- lar Anxiety Disorders, Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, cur- rent substance or alcohol dependence, etc.) that would obviate study participation. The SCID methodology has a strong leg- acy attesting to its reliability and validity for ascertaining psy- chiatric diagnoses. Outcome Measures PSG All study participants underwent three nights (one screen- ing night and two baseline nights following the medication washout phase) of PSG monitoring prior to treatment and an additional two consecutive nights of PSG immediately after treatment. PSG data were collected using CompumedicsTM recording devices at Duke and SandmanTM devices at the Sleep and Alertness Clinic (SAC). These devices are small 32-chan- nel digital PSG recorders that allow sampling rates up to 512 Hz and accommodate a wide range of recording montages. Software accompanying these devices allows for conventional scoring of records. All overnight PSG recordings were conducted in the lab- oratory. The initial PSG was conducted solely to identify and exclude those with significant sleep-disordered breathing or periodic limb movements. The monitoring montage for this initial Screening PSG consisted of the following channels: two EEG (C3-M2 and Oz-Cz), one chin EMG, two EOG (left eye- M1 and right eye-M2), one airflow (nasaloral thermistor),", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 19950, "end_char": 22447}, {"chunk_id": "carney2017cognitive_chunk_013", "source_id": "carney2017cognitive", "text": "32-chan- nel digital PSG recorders that allow sampling rates up to 512 Hz and accommodate a wide range of recording montages.

The remaining for PSGs included only EEG, EOG, and submental EMG leads since these recordings were used only to derive sleepwake meas- ures used in treatment outcome analyses. Electrode attachments for all PSGs was performed in the sleep laboratory by trained technicians. Usual bed and rising times were ascertained for each participant via interview and 1 week of confirmatory sleep diary monitoring, and these usual times were used on the PSG recording nights. All PSGs acquired were scored by experienced sleep technologists using standard scoring crite- ria for sleep stage assignments,39 the identification of apneas/ hpopneas,40 and periodic limb movement-related arousals.41,42 To ensure reliable PSG scoring, a randomly selected 10% of the PSGs conducted each month were rescored by ADK at Duke, and a second technologist at SAC and scoring results were compared. When such comparisons revealed <85% agreement for epoch-by-epoch comparisons of sleep stage scoring and/or <80% agreement for event scoring, the technologists resolved their scoring differences. When preparing for sleep monitoring, study participants were instructed to refrain from caffeine intake after 12:00 PM on the days their PSG studies were scheduled. They were also instructed to abstain from alcohol ingestion and illicit drug use on these days. To assess their compliance with these instructions, they underwent breath-alcohol testing and provided a urine sample for drug screening prior to each PSG.

The program, constructed by the PI using Voiceguide software ( Katalina Technologies, Inc.), presents questions about each nights sleep (i.e., bedtime, sleep onset latency, number and length of nocturnal awakenings, time of final awaking, and rising time). The Interactive Voice Response System program includes queries about caffeine (food/bev- erages), sleep medication, and alcohol use. The wording of the items was based on the now-published Consensus Sleep Diary-Morning Version.43 At the end of the entries for 1 day, the program automatically records a time stamp to verify the time and date that data were entered. There are moderate corre- lations between diary and PSG measures of TWT (r = .73) and SE (r = .66).87 Those with hearing impairments were permit- ted to use paper diaries. Paper diary data were manually double entered into the diary database. Sleep Parameters Primary outcomes were the 2-week means of TWT and SE percentage (SE% = [Total Sleep Time / Time in Bed]  100%) taken from sleep diaries. Secondary sleep outcome measures were TWT and SE% (mean values for two nights at baseline and post-treatment time points), taken from PSG. SE and TWT are widely used indices of sleep improvement in insomnia research because they are sensitive to all possible scenarios of sleep dis- ruption (i.e., sleep onset, sleep maintenance problems, or both). Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)44 is a 7-item scale that assesses the self-reported severity of DSM-IV-defined insomnia symp- toms.

SLEEP, Vol. 40, No. 4, 2017 Quality-of-Life Measure The Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 (MOS SF-36)49: The SF-36 was used to assess changes in perceived health-related qual- ity of life and served as a secondary outcome measure. This 36-item self-report instrument is a reliable and widely used questionnaire49 designed to assess respondents quality-of-life perceptions across a variety of functional domains, such as global Physical Composite (PC) and Mental Composite (MC) scores that respectively summarize global functioning in the physical and mental domains. Medication Quantification Scale The Medication Quantification Scale (MQS)50 provides a quan- titative index for most types of common medications (prescrip- tion and nonprescription) consumed based on the known effects of their long-term use. It provides a means of quantifying dif- ferent types of medications using a common scale. It was orig- inally developed for pain patient trials and has sound validity and reliability.51 The MQS scores are derived on the basis of weights assigned to each type of medication and the actual dos- age levels used. For example, a prn nonsteroidal anti-inflamma- tory medication is assigned a predetermined detrimental weight which is multiplied by dosage weights and then summed across days monitored. This provides a total score that can be entered as a covariate. Measures of Adverse Events The study physician conducted assessments of adverse events at each patient visit using the Adverse Events Form (AEF).

The TEQ consists of five questions (rated on a 7-point scale) assessing respond- ents perceived logic of and confidence in their assigned treat- ment condition, willingness to recommend it to a friend, and so on. The TEQ also includes 2 items assessing the quality of the therapeutic relationship. The TEQ has high internal consist- ency (Cronbachs  = .79)54 and good face validity for assessing treatment credibility and therapist competence/warmth. Treatment Component Checklist To assess treatment fidelity and therapist adherence to spe- cific elements of the two behavioral treatments administered, a Treatment Component Checklist (TCC) was used. This instrument consists of 20 items that describe a therapist verbal instruction or action that should occur either in the CBT-I or SH interventions. Ten of the items pertain specifically to CBT-I, whereas the other 10 specifically describe the SH therapy. An independent rater certified in behavioral sleep medicine (MDL) reviewed and rated the digital recordings of CBT-I and SH ther- apy sessions using the TCC. A therapy fidelity index for each treatment session was computed for each treatment session. A fidelity index = 1.00 suggests that the session included items solely from the treatment intended and was not contaminated by items from the alternate treatment.

Procedures Study candidates telephoned the project coordinator in response to study advertising (i.e., advertisements and brochures in clinics). The project coordinator assessed their interest and eligibility using a brief telephone information and inclusion screen. Those found eligible were then scheduled for an in-lab screening interview at either the Ryerson Sleep and Depression Laboratory or the Duke Insomnia and Sleep Research Program. Participants attended this interview to provide study informa- tion, to obtain informed consent, and to complete the DSISD, HAMD17, SCID, SCID-II, MMSE, and ISI. Those who con- tinued to meet inclusion criteria then completed (a) a standard medical evaluation that included a physical examination and laboratory studies (i.e., chem.-7, abc with differential, thyroid panel, urinalysis and urine drug screen, and a serum pregnancy test if applicable), (b) one night of PSG monitoring, and (c) 1 week of sleep log monitoring. Patients who continued to meet selection criteria and were also taking an antidepressant med- ication began the antidepressant medication washout phase under the direction of the study physician. The length of the washout phase varied depending on the half-life, dose, and dura- tion of the antidepressant medication they were discontinuing. Participants were seen by the study physician weekly during this phase to assess safety. After the washout phase, partici- pants saw the study physician for a safety assessment and began pretreatment (baseline) monitoring, including (a) maintaining IVR sleep diaries to describe each nights sleep for 2 weeks; (b) two consecutive nights of PSG monitoring, and (c) outcome measures (ISI, SF-36). Those who continued to meet all study selection criteria were randomized to treatment groups follow- ing the baseline period.

Randomization was accomplished by a computer-generated randomization paradigm. As a result of random assignment, each study participant received one of three interventions during an 8-week treatment period. Treatment with CBT-I or SH components were provided in 4 weekly individual visits followed by 2 visits scheduled at Week 6 and Week 8, by one of two graduate therapists super- vised by a BSM expert (i.e., the first author). All treatment ses- sions were conducted at the Duke Insomnia and Sleep Research Program clinic during Year 1 and then, for the remainder of the study, sessions were conducted at Ryersons Sleep and Depression Laboratory. The study physician provided patients with medication instructions and medication at the SAC. All participants were asked to maintain nightly IVR sleep diaries and completed treatment adherence ratings throughout the 8-week treatment phase of the project. Immediately after the 8-week treatment phase, study patients underwent a posttreat- ment assessment that included completion of HAMD17 and SCID mood module, all outcome questionnaires, two nights of Lab-PSG monitoring, and 2 weeks of sleep diary monitor- ing. All of these assessments except for PSG monitoring were repeated at the 6-month follow-up. There was not a true follow-up period associated with this study because of stringent safety protocols. Once participants 6 Cognitive Behavioral Insomnia Therapy and DepressionCarney et al.

Although only entering this subset into the follow-up phase limited the abil- ity to examine this data in a meaningful way, it was done to prioritize safety given that some participants received place- bos. Those included in the follow-up phase were maintained on their assigned medication and were asked to attend monthly assessments, conducted primarily for safety purposes, with the Study Physician at the SAC over the 6-month follow-up period. The MQS was completed during every week of the trial and at 6-month follow-up to track the use of nonstudy medications during the trial. At the end of the 6-month follow-up period, participants completed the ISI, SF-36, HAMD17, and 2 weeks of IVR sleep diary monitoring. Interim analyses were conducted on the ISI and HAMD17 as a safety precaution. During this time, all investigators remained blinded to treatment group. Results from these interim analy- ses including the aggregate analysis of proportion of depres- sion responders and insomnia responders was presented at the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies annual conference in Nashville, TN (2013). The trial was concluded as of November 30, 2013, at the end of the funding period. RESULTS Analyses The primary analysis of these variables was conducted using imputed data and under intention to treat.

Demographic and baseline characteristics of the sample are depicted in Table 1. There were no statistically significant differences between groups on age or gender; thus, these variables were not included as covariates in the analyses. Chi-square analyses revealed that there were no baseline group differences on AHI (p = .41) or PLM arousal index (p = .79). Sleep We verified that there were no statistically significant base- line differences and then analyzed baseline to posttreatment differences using an ANOVA (GLM) with pairwise compari- sons, adjusting for medication use (covarying the Medication Quantification Score). Each of the groups improved from base- line to posttreatment (p < .05), and there were no group dif- ferences on mean Sleep Diary (SD) TWT [F = 7.97, p = .9] or on mean SD SE [F = 1.18, p = .7].

To understand the clinical significance of the treatments, we tested whether there were any differences in those attaining self-reported good sleeper status at posttreatment (i.e., ISI < 8); the chi-square was not statistically significant (2 (2) = 2.3, p = .31). Insomnia remission (ISI < 8) was identical for both CBT groups (22% each) and lower, albeit not statistically, for the AD+SH group (only 6% meeting the good sleeper cut- score).

There were no group differences on GH (p = .99) or PF (p = .99). Treatment Credibility Treatment credibility was assessed at pre- and posttreatment via a repeated measures multivariate ANOVA. On the omnibus test, there was a main effect for time (p = .02) but no group  time interaction (p = .98). An examination of the follow-up ANOVAs revealed that only the items: confident in recommending the treatment to a friend and confident that treatment will be suc- cessful for self changed over time (both at p < .01). In both cases, ratings increased at posttreatment (i.e., they became more confident that it was successful for self and that they would rec- ommend it to a friend). In other words, at baseline, the mean for recommending it to a friend was 5.62 (SD = 1.1), and it increased at posttreatment to M = 6.13 (SD = 1.1); the maximum score possible is 7, meaning that you are very likely to recommend it to a friend.

When a graduate student no longer worked on the trial, a new therapist was substituted into the randomization table for the for- mer therapist. Seven of the reviewed Session 1 tapes were the SH group. The first session for SH consisted of a review of sleep logs and sleep complaints only and scores should be close to 0; that is, almost no elements of CBT should be heard on the tape. The mean score was 0.14 (SD = .38) for Session 1 of SH. The remaining reviewed tapes (N = 26) were in the CBT group; their score should be close to the maximum score of 15, meaning that most of the elements of Session 1 should be heard on the tape. The mean score for Session 1 of CBT was 13.25 (SD = 1.0). Digital audio files for the first session were sent to an independent rater for review. The independent rater (MDL) is a licensed psycholo- gist certified in behavioral sleep medicine. The rater completed the same TCC, and we tested whether the independent raters TCC scores differed from the therapists. The independent rater also evaluated (yes/no) whether the SH group received any CBT- specific interventionsthere were no such violations. The result- ing  value revealed a very high rate of agreement (.9). Thus, by both PI supervision and oversight and independent rater treatment components, treatment fidelity was very high in this study. DISCUSSION Results from this trial indicate that although three combinations of depression and insomnia treatments were helpful in produc- ing subjective improvements for insomnia and depression, a depression-only approach objectively worsened sleep.

With respect to subjective insomnia indices, all groups did reasonably well, with improved scores on both ISI and sleep diary indices from baseline to posttreatment. One possible explanation may relate to sleep hygiene being a poor control sleep therapy condition. This therapy controlled for nonspe- cific effects, as the material was presented by the same ther- apists for the same amount of time as CBT-I groups. There is some support for sleep hygiene as a treatment for insomnia (e.g.,55,56); however, when considering the evidence collectively, Figure 2Polysomnography (PSG) change in total wake time.

Previous research has shown that subjective assessment of insomnia using sleep items on depression inventories is associated with modest improvement in some58,59 and worsening in others.60 The lack of a follow-up period precludes us from knowing whether the subjective benefit would have any durability. Another possible explanation for the lack of separation for the sleep hygiene and CBT-I groups on subjective insomnia improve- ment may relate to the dose of CBT-I in this trial. Participants in this study were those with both insomnia and MDD. Although 4 sessions are optimal in those with insomnia alone,61 it is possible that individuals with both insomnia and depression would benefit from a longer treatment period, as some studies62 report somewhat diminished treatment effect sizes in those with comorbidities. However, a meta-analysis including studies of differing treatment duration found similarly large effects, such as observed in this trial, in those with comorbid insomnias.63 Similarly, it is possible that the therapy was not potent enough because it was delivered by novices (i.e., graduate students). Although fidelity to the protocol was measured formally, there was no formal competence evaluation beyond the observation of the students and weekly supervision of these sleep-therapy naive novice therapists. Additionally, there was some inequality with the AD condition, in that a licensed, medical prescriber with decades more clinical experience was interacting with participants, in comparison to the inexperienced therapists for the cognitive behavioral components.

In fact, it is promising for widespread dissemi- nation that, similar to other studies similar to other studies,6467 this brief insomnia treatment is effectively delivered to complex patients by novice nonsleep specialist providers. Although there was no separation on the mean subjective appraisal of sleep, the rate of those in the AD+SH group becoming good sleepers by the end of the treatment was only 6% as compared to over 20% in the CBT groups. Moreover, the differences in the between group effect sizes for subjective TWT and PSG indices were small for the comparison of the CBT groups and the CBT+AD and AD+SH group, but the effect size for the comparison of the CBT+Placebo and AD + SH group was medium. This con- sistent pattern suggests the possibility that there may be sleep differences for the two control group conditions (CBT-I + PD and AD+SH) that may have emerged if sufficiently powered. Although there was no statistical separation on the mean sub- jective appraisal of sleep, there were statistically meaningful group differences in objective sleep; that is, in the group with- out the antidepressant (CBT-I + PD), there was improvement in the time spent awake via PSG, but in the antidepressant plus control therapy, there was a worsening in the amount of time spent awake. This finding is perhaps not surprising, as there are studies using objective polysomnographic indices finding that a proportion of SSRI-treated patients experience a disturbance of their sleep,68 and these objective sleep problems can last as long as 30 weeks after SSRI discontinuation.6871 Thus, there were subjective improvements reported by many of those on antide- pressants but an objective worsening if the antidepressant was paired with sleep hygiene (i.e., CBT-I was not used). Given the widespread use and belief that sleep hygiene is effective,57 this finding suggests antidepressants should not be augmented with sleep hygiene if improved objective sleep is desired. Although subjective sleep is the most typical target in insomnia treatment, growing research suggests that objective indices such as total sleep time may relate to adverse health outcomes such as cogni- tive impairment, hypertension, and diabetes.7274 Thus, evidence of objective sleep worsening", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 50793, "end_char": 53406}, {"chunk_id": "carney2017cognitive_chunk_032", "source_id": "carney2017cognitive", "text": ".6871 Thus, there were subjective improvements reported by many of those on antide- pressants but an objective worsening if the antidepressant was paired with sleep hygiene (i.e., CBT-I was not used).

Although subjective sleep is the most typical target in insomnia treatment, growing research suggests that objective indices such as total sleep time may relate to adverse health outcomes such as cogni- tive impairment, hypertension, and diabetes.7274 Thus, evidence of objective sleep worsening in antidepressant therapy is cause for concern. There were no differences in depression whether someone received a depression treatment or not; that is, all three groups showed improvements with large effect sizes on depression. The between-group effects were small which has been found in other studies examining CBT-I.78 These results are also consist- ent with previous studies suggesting CBT-I is associated with improvements in depression symptoms as well as increased rates of depressive remission.75 In another study CBT-I was shown to potentiate the antidepressant effects of the medication,24 but this did not occur in this study. Although posttreatment sleep pre- dicted posttreatment depression status, there was no evidence that the combined depression and insomnia treatment fared any better than the CBT-I alone group or the AD + SH group. It is unclear why we did not see this effect. The Manber et al. study was a small study and the only comparison study to date, so it is possible that these findings were anomalous. It is also possible that this study was statistically underpowered, since our final sample size was less than the a priori power analysis suggested was necessary. The CBT-I + PD was no different than the active antidepres- sant medication treatment groups on depression symptom sever- ity, and their sleep was objectively and subjectively improved (the effect sizes for this group in comparison to the AD+SH control were medium in size for diary and PSG TWT as well as PSG SE). Given that this group did well with respect to sleep, and just as well with respect to depression, it may be tempting to see this insomnia-only treatment choice as viable because it Table 4Multiple regression predicting posttreatment HAMD17 with sleep items removed.

SLEEP, Vol. 40, No. 4, 2017 would be shorter than a lengthy antidepressant course; however, this interpretation should be considered in light of the follow- ing study design features. First, these participants were taking a placebo pill so we do not know what would happen if CBT-I was delivered in isolation. Second, this study is limited in that the sample included only those who met criteria for both insomnia disorder and MDD, and thus, these results, at best, can general- ize only to those who have both disorders. There are some with MDD who do not have insomnia disorder and some who expe- rience hypersomnia; thus, these results may not generalize to the range of people with depression. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, the analyses were underpowered according to the a pri- ori power analysis, so it is possible that the antidepressant treat- ment groups could have produced superior depression treatment responses, but the insufficient sample size precluded adequate power analyses. The CBT-I plus placebo was not significantly different from the other CBT group on any index. Finally, safety precautions in the trial precluded a rigorous assessment of fol- low-up effects of all of the treatments, so we do not know the long-term effects of any of these treatments. This is a limitation that was necessary due to safety, but this design issue is signif- icant because it is unknown as to whether the treatments would have had durable effects. It would be important to find a safe way to explore durability in future research.

It would be important to find a safe way to explore durability in future research. The aforementioned caveats withstanding, there may be rea- sons why CBT-I seems to help with MDD. Although this trial did not contain an investigation of treatment mechanisms, CBT-I targets the time spent in bed in a 24-hr period via sleep restriction and stimulus control, which promotes more time out of bed and increased activation. Future studies should consider increased behavioral activation as a possible mechanism of change in CBT-I for depression. In addition, more time out of bed also generally means increased light exposure, which may be another possible mechanism. Excess rapid eye movement (REM) sleep has been shown to have a depressant effect,76 and since CBT-I tends to limit excessive time in bed in the morning hours, this may prevent excess REM sleep. Future studies should focus on the mechanisms of sleep improvement on mood. In sum, CBT-I was a brief but effective treatment for insom- nia in those with MDD, both on subjective and on objective measures of sleep, even when delivered by novice therapists, and with benefits on depression that were indistinguishable from antidepressant medication. Although the combination of an antidepressant medication with sleep hygiene produced a positive, subjective appraisal of sleep, the combination of anti- depressant medication and sleep hygiene was associated with an objective increase in the time spent awake in bed. Thus, CBT-I appears to be an important component of depression management for those with both MDD and insomnia disorder, and future research should explore the antidepressant mecha- nisms of CBT-I.

Most existing studies have used self-reported smartphone use data. Moreover, few studies have simultaneously examined associations between both smartphone addiction and objectively measured smartphone use and sleep, and the dose-response relationship between smartphone use and risk of poor sleep has been consistently overlooked, requiring systematic and further research on this topic. Objective: This study aimed to examine the associations between smartphone addiction and objectively measured smartphone use and sleep quality and duration. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 17,713 participants from a university in China. We assessed objective smart- phone screen time and unlocks by collecting screenshots of use records and measured smartphone addiction using a validated questionnaire. Sleep quality and duration were estimated via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Binary logistic regression, linear regression, and restricted cubic spline regression models were used for the analyses. Results: A total of 14.3% (2533/17,713) of the participants met the criterion for poor sleep, with a mean sleep duration of 507.1 (SD 103.2) minutes per night. Notably, university students with smartphone addiction exhibited 184% higher risk of poor sleep (odds ratio [OR] 2.84, 95% CI 2.59-3.11) and a 15.47-minuteshorter nighttime sleep duration (=15.47, 95% CI 18.53 to 12.42) compared to those without smartphone addiction.

JMIR Ment Health 2025;12:e77796; doi: 10.2196/77796 Keywords: smartphone addiction; smartphone screen time; smartphone unlocks; sleep disorders; sleep duration Introduction In the digital age, youths spend more time on smartphones than ever before, and smartphones have become an ines- capable part of everyday life [1]. Adequate and high-qual- ity sleep plays a pivotal role in sustaining physiological and psychological well-being. Poor sleep quality alongside inadequate duration is both prevalent and strongly linked to elevated risks of adverse health outcomes [2-4] and, thus, has become a notable concern. Over recent decades, epidemio- logical evidence has indicated a progressive deterioration in both average sleep quality and duration [5], with roughly 33% of the global population falling short of internation- ally recommended nocturnal sleep thresholds (79 hours per night). Given the public health impact of poor and insuffi- cient sleep, there is a critical need to better understand the potential influence of ubiquitous smartphones in impairing sleep health. Numerous studies have linked smartphone use with poor sleep and shorter sleep duration [6-12], whereas few studies have reported that smartphone screen time correlates with poorer sleep quality but has minimal effects on sleep duration [9,13]. Conversely, 2 studies found no association between the daily use of technology devices and sleep outcomes [14, 15]. Notably, the current generation of youth, referred to as iGens by Twenge [16], has grown up in the smartphone era and is characterized by elevated rates of smartphone use and smartphone addiction [17]. University students today belong to the iGeneration, who are more prone to severe smartphone addiction and maladaptive use that may impair sleep quality and duration in the absence of familial oversight. This risk is particularly concerning because poor or insuffi- cient sleep can exacerbate mental health issues, which have already garnered broad societal attention,", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 3246, "end_char": 5843}, {"chunk_id": "yin2025associations_chunk_004", "source_id": "yin2025associations", "text": "2 studies found no association between the daily use of technology devices and sleep outcomes [14, 15].

University students today belong to the iGeneration, who are more prone to severe smartphone addiction and maladaptive use that may impair sleep quality and duration in the absence of familial oversight. This risk is particularly concerning because poor or insuffi- cient sleep can exacerbate mental health issues, which have already garnered broad societal attention, especially against the backdrop of Chinas rapidly accelerating pace of life. Previous research has posited that smartphones may affect sleep via multiple mechanisms. First, the time displacement hypothesis posits that excessive smartphone use potentially comes at the cost of sleep [18] as each additional hour of screen time theoretically reduces available sleep hours. A prospective cohort study showed that excessive smartphone use was related to shorter total sleep time in children [19]; the total sleep time of the smartphone overuse group (smartphone use of over 1 hour per day) was shorter than that of the control group. Second, prolonged smartphone screen time increases exposure to screen-emitted light [20]. More light exposure from smartphones could delay melatonin onset, disrupting the circadian rhythm and thereby reducing sleep quality and duration. Phillips et al [21] demonstrated that evening exposure to light at intensities below 30 lux, which is comparable to that emitted by smartphones, suppressed melatonin by 50%. Furthermore, the electromagnetic fields emitted by smartphones have also been identified as a significant factor influencing sleep. A study by Huber et al [22] revealed that exposure to pulse-modulated electro- magnetic fields increased relative regional cerebral blood flow in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ipsilateral to the exposure and enhanced electroencephalographic power in the alpha frequency range before sleep onset and in the spin- dle frequency range during stage 2 sleep. Third, psychologi- cal and physical arousal induced by engaging, entertaining, or distressing content from various smartphone apps may also impair the ability to fall asleep and maintain sleep [23, 24]. Meyerson et al [25] leveraged estimated bedtimes from 44,000 Reddit users and their 120 million posts, revealing that users who posted 4 or more times within 1 hour before bedtime had a 4-fold higher risk of delayed sleep onset compared to those who posted 2 to 5", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 5169, "end_char": 7842}, {"chunk_id": "yin2025associations_chunk_005", "source_id": "yin2025associations", "text": "ographic power in the alpha frequency range before sleep onset and in the spin- dle frequency range during stage 2 sleep.

Despite a growing body of research on the association between smartphone use and sleep, methodological and dimensional limitations persist. First, the widespread use of smartphones in everyday life points to the need for rigorous and objective methods that can adequately capture the true links between smartphone use behavior and sleep. However, most existing studies rely on participants self- reported smartphone use data. This is an important limita- tion because previous research has shown that self-reported smartphone use is prone to recall bias and misclassification errors and does not correlate well with objectively measured smartphone use [26-29]. A neglected aspect of smartphone use is unlocks, defined as the number of times that users activate their smartphone screen within a specific period, a behavior reflecting compulsive urges for immediate interac- tion. As a dimension distinct from smartphone screen time, unlocks represent dynamic user-device interaction patterns [30,31] whose potential impact on sleep remains understud- ied. Second, research on the association between smartphone use and sleep has been siloed, focusing exclusively on either smartphone addiction or smartphone use (eg, duration). These 2 dimensions represent different metrics of smartphone use [32-34]. Smartphone addiction has been defined as an individuals excessive and uncontrollable use of smartphones, resulting in impaired social functioning and psychological and behavioral problems [35,36]. Smartphone screen time is neither a necessary criterion nor a precise proxy for addic- tion as users with shorter smartphone screen time may still exhibit addictive symptoms, whereas those with longer screen time might engage in adaptive use [32]. Thus, analyzing smartphone addiction and smartphone use behaviors is essential to understanding the full impact of smartphones on sleep. To date, few studies have examined the associa- tions between both smartphone addiction and smartphone JMIR MENTAL HEALTH Yin et al https://mental.jmir.org/2025/1/e77796 JMIR Ment Health 2025 | vol. 12", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 7254, "end_char": 9949}, {"chunk_id": "yin2025associations_chunk_006", "source_id": "yin2025associations", "text": " psychological and behavioral problems [35,36].

Moreover, previous research has often treated smartphone addiction and smartphone use behaviors as categorical variables in traditional regression models, thereby overlooking the potential for dose-response associations between continuous smartphone use and risk of poor sleep. Consequently, less is known about associa- tions between different points along the continuum of both smartphone use and smartphone addiction and sleep quality or duration. This large-scale study adopted a more holistic perspective with a representative sample, assessing objective smartphone use by collecting screenshots of participants smartphone screen time and unlock records and measuring smartphone addiction through a validated questionnaire, with the aim of examining whether smartphone addiction and objectively measured smartphone use were associated with sleep quality and duration among university students. We also conducted restricted cubic splines (RCS) regression to better understand the dose-response relationship between smartphone use and sleep. Methods Study Population In this cross-sectional study, a university in Shaanxi province, China, was randomly selected from the provincial registry of higher-education institutions. All 24,156 students in this university were invited to participate in the survey. Before data collection, training sessions were conducted for all class counselors to explain the study objectives and procedures. They subsequently facilitated the anonymous completion of a structured electronic questionnaire by the students. From the 22,047 questionnaires received, submissions were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: (1) completion time of less than 500 seconds, (2) failure on one or more atten- tion-check questions, (3) inability to provide valid smart- phone use screenshots, or (4) implausible sleep metric data. Consequently, a total of 17,713 students were included in the final analyses. A flowchart of the screening of the study participants is shown in Multimedia Appendix 1.

Ethical Considerations The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong Univer- sity provided ethics approval for this study (approval ID: 2022-248). All participants gave their electronic informed consent before taking part in the study. All personally identifiable information was removed during data preparation and analysis and was not included in the manuscript or supplementary materials. No images or visual identifiers of participants are included in the study. Participants received no financial compensation for their involvement. This study followed the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) reporting guide- line and CONSORT-EHEALTH (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials of Electronic and Mobile Health Applica- tions and Online Telehealth) checklist [37]. The CONSORT- EHEALTH checklist is shown in Checklist 1. Measures Smartphone Addiction The Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale (MPATS), originally developed by Xiong et al [38] for Chinese university populations, was used to evaluate smartphone addiction in this study. The scale comprises 16 items across 4 dimensions consisting of salience, withdrawal symptoms, social comfort, and mood changes. The items are scored on a scale from 1 (very inconsistent) to 5 (very consistent), yielding a total score between 16 and 80. Elevated total scores correlate with greater severity of smartphone addiction, with scores of 48 defining smartphone addiction. In this study, the Cronbach  coefficient was 0.94. Objectively Measured Smartphone Use The objectively measured smartphone use included smart- phone screen time and unlocks. In this study, upon provid- ing informed consent, participants were instructed to capture and submit screenshots of their smartphone use during the previous full week, which was automatically recorded by the built-in Screen Time tool of the iOS system and the Digital Wellbeing tool of the Android system.

The operat- ing system passively records these behavioral data through a triggering mechanism involving screen photoelectric sensors, representing an objective measurement approach independent of self-reporting. Previous studies have validated the use of such built-in tracking systems to obtain objective smartphone use behavior as accurate and reliable for capturing actual use patterns [29,39]. The 7-day assessment period aligns with those of most studies in this field [40-42]. There is evidence suggesting that less than 1 week of smartphone data collection is already sufficient to capture typical smart- phone use behaviors [43]. Furthermore, to mitigate poten- tial variation between weekdays and weekends and enhance the representativeness, participants were instructed to submit screenshots encompassing a full week (5 weekdays and 2 weekend days). Two weeks before the formal investigation of this study, we instructed the participants to activate the function for smartphone records to ensure the availability of objective data. We then provided step-by-step instructions for screenshots for different brands and types of smartphones and required them to submit the screenshots covering (1) smartphone screen time during the previous week and (2) number of smartphone unlocks during the previous week. According to the distribution of the screen time data, we classified participants into 4 groups (approximately 0-21, 21-42, 42-63, and 63 hours per week). In accordance with the distribution of our datasets, and to ensure better practical guidance, we partitioned smartphone unlocks into quartiles, selecting integer thresholds around quartile points. Conse- quently, we classified participants into 4 groups for smart- phone unlocks (approximately 0-50, 50-150, 150-400, and 400 times per week). Sleep Quality and Duration The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was adminis- tered to evaluate sleep quality over the previous month [44].

Each domain is scored on a scale between 0 and 3, with elevated scores representing poorer sleep. Aggregating scores across domains produces a composite PSQI score spanning 0 to 21, where higher scores signify poorer sleep quality. A score of 8 was used to define poor sleep in accordance with the validated cutoff for the Chinese population [45], which has demonstra- ted good reliability and validity in previous representative studies [46,47]. In this study, the Cronbach  coefficient of the PSQI was 0.85. Sleep duration was evaluated via the following question: Over the past month, how many hours did you typically spend asleep at night? This time should exclude time spent in bed without falling asleep. Covariates We developed a structured questionnaire to gather several confounding factors. Sociodemographic information included gender, university year, race, registered permanent residence, whether the participants had siblings, and parental educa- tional attainment. As described in a previous study [48], health-related lifestyles comprised current smoking, current drinking, physical activity, and rational diet. Participants who had smoked at least one cigarette in the previous 30 days were classified as current smokers. Similarly, those who had consumed at least one glass of wine during the previous 30 days were categorized as currently drinking. The International Physical Activity QuestionnaireShort Form was used to assess physical activity [49], categorizing activity levels into low, moderate, and high according to established calcula- ted metabolic equivalents.

An irrational diet was defined as participants consuming red meat every day or vegetables and fruits less than daily. As previous studies have reported significant relation- ships between social support and sleep, the Adolescent Social Support Scale (ASSS) was administered to quantify social support [50]. The ASSS is a 16-item instrument, with each item scored on a scale from 1 to 5. A higher score signifies greater social support. The Cronbach  coefficient of the ASSS was 0.88, indicating strong internal consistency. Statistical Analyses Participant characteristics were described using frequency distributions for categorical variables, as well as means and SDs for continuous variables. Three sets of binary logistic and linear regression models were constructed to estimate odds ratios and 95% CIs for poor sleep, as well as  coefficients and corresponding 95% CIs for sleep duration. Covariates included sex, university year, race, registered permanent residence, whether the participants had siblings, parental educational attainment, current smoking, current drinking, physical activity, rational diet, and social support. RCS regression was used to model dose-response associations between both smartphone addiction and objectively measured smartphone use and sleep quality and duration. In addition, we tested for interaction between smartphone use and sex to determine whether sex modified the relationships. To reduce the possible effects of the unbalanced sex ratio of the participants, we conducted a sex-weighted logistic regression. Moreover, a multilevel model with college under university as a random effect was conducted to mitigate the college under university clustering effects. In all tests, a 2-sided P value of <.05 was used as a significance threshold. The R software (version 4.0.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing) was used for all data analyses.

Similarly, compared to those with approximately 0 to 50 smartphone unlocks per week, those with 400 unlocks per week had a significantly shorter sleep duration (=4.09, 95% CI 8.08 to 0.0), and participants with 50 to 150 smartphone unlocks per week had a longer sleep duration (=5.84, 95% CI 2.32-9.36).

What is more, an inverted Ushape nonlinear relationship was observed between smartphone screen time and reduc- tion in sleep duration (P<.001 for nonlinearity), whereas increasing smartphone unlocks were found to be associated with monotonically decreasing sleep duration (P=.31 for nonlinearity; Figure 1). Sex-Stratified Analyses The results of the sex-stratified analyses are shown in Table 3. This study found significant sex-specific differences in the relationships between smartphone screen time (P=.01 for the interaction) and unlocks (P=.002 for the interaction) and sleep duration. Notably, a 21hour per week increase in smartphone screen time (=0.13, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.08) and a 50time per week increase in unlocks (=0.77, 95% CI 1.08 to 0.47) were significantly associated with sleep duration in female individuals but not significant in male individuals. No significant sex-specific differences were observed in the relationships between smartphone addiction and sleep quality and duration (P>.05 for the interaction in all cases), nor were there significant associations between smartphone screen time and unlocks and sleep quality (P>.05 for the interaction in all cases; Table 3).

Specifically, we found significant negative associations between smartphone addiction and both sleep quality and duration. Excessive objectively measured screen time and unlocks were significantly and positively associated with poor sleep and shorter sleep duration. Comparison With Other Studies Despite the growing number of studies on the association between smartphone use and sleep, previous research has been mainly siloed, focusing exclusively on the effect of either smartphone addiction or objectively measured smartphone use on sleep quality. For instance, a systematic review revealed a significantly increased risk of poor sleep in individuals with smartphone addiction [51]. In a comple- mentary nationally representative twin study, self-reported problematic digital technology use remained significantly correlated with poor sleep after accounting for confound- ers [52]. More recently, a study among university stu- dents uncovered positive associations between smartphone addiction and both bedtime procrastination and poor sleep [53]. Kaya et al [7] reported a significant relationship between self-reported smartphone use and poor sleep quality among university students using the Smartphone Addiction Scale Short Version to assess smartphone addiction. Another study showed that smartphone addiction was linked to sleep quality and sleep duration [54]. The results of this study on the association between smartphone addiction and sleep are consistent with the findings of these studies. In recent years, studies have increasingly focused on associations between smartphone use behaviors and sleep outcomes, yet reported findings remain inconsistent. For instance, a small-sample study using daily self-report smartphone use data found no association between smart- phone talk time or screen time and sleep quality and duration [15]. In contrast, a larger study among adults revealed that self-reported daily smartphone use time was linked to poorer sleep quality, whereas unlocks showed no association with sleep parameters [55]. However, most existing research relies on self-reported smartphone use data, which are suscepti- ble to recall bias and misclassification. The inconsistencies across findings highlight the critical need for more objective measures of smartphone screen time and unlocks to capture the true associations between smartphone use and sleep. To date, few studies have leveraged objectively measured smartphone use data to explore associations with sleep [13, 56,57], and no consensus has been reached regarding these relationships.

To date, few studies have leveraged objectively measured smartphone use data to explore associations with sleep [13, 56,57], and no consensus has been reached regarding these relationships. A study directly measured smartphone screen time in 136 participants via a tracking app and found that longer smartphone screen time was associated with poorer sleep efficiency and shorter sleep duration [56]. A Chinese study tracked participants smartphone use using the same method and indicated that each minute of daytime smartphone use was related to a 0.07-minute reduction in same-night total sleep time but unrelated to sleep efficiency and postsleep awakenings [57]. Only 1 recent study identified smartphone screen time and unlocks as significant predictors of total sleep time, albeit concluding that this effect was minimal [13]. All 3 of these studies concur that excessive objectively meas- ured smartphone use reduces sleep duration while showing less consistency in their findings regarding the impact on sleep quality, particularly sleep efficiency. Notably, our study confirmed that excessive smartphone screen time and unlocks were associated with reductions in sleep duration by 6.66 minutes and 9.90 minutes per night, respectively, as well as an increased risk of poor sleep. Novelly, an inverted Ushaped nonlinear association was observed between smartphone screen time and reduc- tion in sleep duration. The inverted Ushaped relationship was matched by a corresponding delay in sleep offset. No previous studies have focused on the dose-response relationship between smartphone use and sleep, although some support can be drawn from several studies on pre- sleep smartphone use. For example, a study that objectively assessed smartphone use before sleep using a tracking app found that using smartphones before sleep for longer than usual was associated with sleeping earlier and sleeping longer among adolescents [58], suggesting a potentially positive effect on sleep duration. A recent study showed that total screen use in the 2 hours before bedtime was associated with delayed sleep onset but not with total sleep time [9]. Similarly, Exelmans and Van den Bulck [59] suggested that bedtime smartphone use predicted later rise times, which may indicate a compensation behavior for missed sleep.

Collec- tively, these 3 studies suggest that the impact of smartphone use on sleep duration may be less pronounced than that shown in some studies based on self-reported smartphone use data. Our study further identified an inverted Usha- ped relationship between average smartphone use time and sleep duration via RCS regression, providing an important contribution to the existing literature. However, as this was a cross-sectional study that assessed associations at a single time point, longitudinal cohort research is critical to validate causality and assess long-term trajectories. In this study, the  coefficient for the association between both smartphone screen time and unlocks and sleep duration was more pronounced in female than in male individuals. Sex differences in the association may stem from sex-spe- cific preferences for smartphone apps. Compared with male individuals, female individuals exhibit stronger preferences for social media platforms [60], which are characterized by high unlock frequencies. Social media platforms are highly interactive, marked by frequent user engagement. The captivating content on these platforms is more likely to induce emotional arousal and subsequent sleep onset delay. This study did not evaluate sex-specific app preferen- ces among students. Hence, future research should gather detailed data on the use of apps to further explore sex-specific differences and underlying mechanisms.

The reduction in sleep dura- tion among university students with high smartphone use levels can be mechanistically explained through several pathways. The negative impact of smartphone use on sleep duration is consistent with the time displacement hypothe- sis [18], whereas the impairments in sleep quality can be explained by the combined effects of screen-emitted light on melatonin suppression [20] and psychological arousal from engaging content [23", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 40347, "end_char": 43148}, {"chunk_id": "yin2025associations_chunk_030", "source_id": "yin2025associations", "text": " Ment Health 2025 | vol. 12 | e77796 | p. 11 (page number not for citation purposes) Possible Explanations of the Associations Several reasons may underlie the association between smartphone use and sleep.

The negative impact of smartphone use on sleep duration is consistent with the time displacement hypothe- sis [18], whereas the impairments in sleep quality can be explained by the combined effects of screen-emitted light on melatonin suppression [20] and psychological arousal from engaging content [23,24]. Furthermore, the association between smartphone addiction and sleep may additionally involve individuals negative cognitive appraisals of their use, such as perceived loss of control over smartphone use and guilt regarding excessive use, which may exacer- bate sleep impairment. However, the reduction in sleep duration observed among students with low smartphone use levels represents a key novelty of this study, and it may be attributed to the following mechanisms. First, from a psychosocial perspective, smartphones have become highly integrated into the social interactions and academic activi- ties of university students. Excessively low smartphone use may indicate potential difficulties in social connection or emotion regulation for individuals [61], and these factors are established risk factors for sleep, thus accounting for the observed reduction in sleep duration in the context of low smartphone use. Second, from a theoretical standpoint, the conservation of resources theory posits that technolo- gies such as smartphones play a crucial role in the acquisi- tion and maintenance of psychosocial resources [62]. Two studies even showed that smartphone nonusers are gener- ally more prone to experiencing depression and anxiety [63, 64]. Another study measured objective smartphone use in the context of the relationship between smartphone use and well-being, showing that people with intermediate smart- phone use had better mood and lower loneliness than those with low smartphone use [65]. Third, in terms of sleep behavior patterns, individuals with low smartphone use may exhibit an earlier sleep phase, especially for those who rise early, which can result in objectively shorter total sleep duration. An objective measurement study using a wearable sleep and activity tracker, smartphone-delivered ecological momentary assessments, and passive smartphone use tracking also reported a similar pattern [65], finding that individuals with low bedtime smartphone use had earlier wake times (9:25 AM; 1 hour, 30 minutes to +1 hour, 30 minutes) than high bedtime smartphone users (10:", "token_count": 512, "start_char": 42488, "end_char": 45257}, {"chunk_id": "yin2025associations_chunk_031", "source_id": "yin2025associations", "text": " had better mood and lower loneliness than those with low smartphone use [65].

Limitations First, although the models included a wide range of dem- ographic and lifestyle factors, some confounding variables may have remained unaccounted for, potentially influencing the study findings. Second, sleep quality and duration were assessed using a retrospective self-report questionnaire, which may result in recall bias. Future studies would benefit from incorporating objective sleep measurements to triangulate the findings. Third, due to the cross-sectional study design, causal inferences regarding the relationship between smartphone use and sleep cannot be made. Future longitudinal studies are warranted to address it. Fourth, the generalizability of our findings may be limited by the exclusive focus on university students in China and the uneven sex distribution in the study sample. Fifth, although this study objectively meas- ured smartphone use time and frequency via smartphone screenshot, data in this study still lack granularity regarding temporal dynamics (eg, distribution over the day or week) and functional variation (eg, social media, entertainment, education, or work). These details may be important for understanding the nuanced associations between smartphone use and sleep. Sixth, although the multilevel model treating class membership as a random effect yielded substantially unchanged results, this study did not account for cluster- ing effects stemming from shared living or social environ- ments (eg, classes, dormitories, and clubs). Future research could address these clustering effects by implementing simple random sampling methods, which would help minimize potential biases arising from nonindependent observations. Conclusions This study found significant associations between smart- phone addiction, excessive objectively measured screen time, and unlocks and both poor sleep and shorter sleep dura- tion.
