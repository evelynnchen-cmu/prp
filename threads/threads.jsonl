Research indicates that greater within-person consistency in sleep across nights is associated with better health and performance outcomes. Irregular sleep-wake patterns are linked to increased risks for cardiometabolic diseases and cardiovascular events (zuraikat2024consistency, zuraikat2024consistency_chunk_001). Specifically, a study utilizing data from the UK Biobank found that greater sleep regularity was associated with significantly lower risk for all-cause mortality, with 1859 deaths occurring among 60,997 participants over an 8-year period, equating to 4.84 deaths per 1000 person-years (zuraikat2024consistency, zuraikat2024consistency_chunk_001).\n\n2. **Sleep Duration**: While sleep duration has been extensively studied, with both short (<7 hours) and long (>8 hours) sleep durations linked to adverse mental health outcomes (li2025regular, li2025regular_chunk_003), the evidence suggests that the quality and consistency of sleep may be equally, if not more, important. For instance, the Sleep Regularity Index (SRI) quantifies sleep consistency and has been associated with various health outcomes, including mental health and cardiovascular risk (maki2025sleep, maki2025sleep_chunk_003). \n\n3. **Comparative Insights**: The evidence indicates that while sleep duration is a significant factor in health, sleep regularity may provide additional protective effects. For example, higher SRI scores, indicating more regular sleep patterns, have been linked to decreased mental exhaustion and better overall health outcomes (maki2025sleep, maki2025sleep_chunk_003). However, direct comparisons of the robustness of mortality risk prediction between sleep regularity and sleep duration have not been extensively studied (zuraikat2024consistency, zuraikat2024consistency_chunk_001).\n\nIn summary, both sleep consistency and sleep duration play vital roles in health, with sleep regularity emerging as a potentially more critical factor in certain health outcomes. The provided evidence does not contain information about specific comparative statistics between the two dimensions beyond the general associations mentioned.

While numerous studies have focused on sleep duration, with both short and long sleep durations associated with adverse mental health outcomes (Chunnan, Shaomei, & Wannian, 2022), mounting evidence suggests that other dimensions of sleep may be equally important. Sleep regularity, the day-to-day consistency in sleepwake timing rather than the amount of sleep obtained, has emerged as a potentially critical component of healthy sleep (Windred et al., 2024). The sleep regularity index (SRI), developed by Phillips et al., quantifies the probability of an individual being in the same sleepwake state at any two time points 24 hours apart (Phillips et al., 2017), thus capturing the stability of circadian timing independent of total sleep duration.

Epidemiological evi- dence suggests that greater within-person consistency in sleep across nights relates to better health and performance [1], and irregularity in sleepwake patterns has emerged as a prominent risk factor for incident cardiometabolic diseases [24] and car- diovascular events [5]. However, few studies have assessed pro- spective associations of within-person consistency in sleepwake patterns, hereafter referred to as sleep regularity, with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Furthermore, no prior study has compared directly the robustness of mortality risk prediction of sleep regularity versus other important dimensions of sleep, such as sleep duration. In this issue of SLEEP, Windred et al. examined the role of sleep regularity in risk for mortality [6]. Using data from participants in the UK biobank who had completed 7 days of actigraphy during visits conducted between 2013 and 2016, the authors computed a sleep regularity index (SRI) score. Briefly, the SRI provides a gran- ular measure of concordance in patterns of sleep and wake states across days of recording, with higher scores indicative of greater interdaily consistency in sleepwake timing [6, 7].

The Sleep Regularity Index (SRI), introduced in 2017, quantifies an individuals sleep/wake cycle consistency over time, by measuring the likelihood of being in the same state (asleep or awake) at two points separated by 24 h (Phillips et al., 2017). Research has associated the SRI with factors such as circadian misalignment (Phillips et al., 2017), academic performance (Phillips et al., 2017), cardiovascular risk (Lunsford-Avery et al., 2018), and self-reported depression severity (Lunsford-Avery et al., 2018). Lower SRI scores have also been linked to relapse and excessive daytime napping during inpatient treatment in individuals with alcohol use disorder (Barb et al., 2022; Brooks et al., 2020). Conversely, higher SRI scores, indicating more regular sleep and wake times, were associated with decreased mental exhaustion in the same population (Brooks et al., 2020).

Timing of sleep and chronotype are also important issues to be investigated in terms of both private and public health. 12. Conclusions Both sleep quantity and sleep quality are fundamental components of sleep. Since there are marked inter-individual differences in the need for sleep, sleep quantity might be assessed not by actual duration but by a deviation from the individuals own optimal sleep quantity. For sleep quality, no standardized scale has been established, probably because sleep quality has many aspects. The variables for sleep quality can be selected depending on the purpose of the study. At present, many studies have decided that sleep quality, rather than sleep quantity, is favorable for reecting health or functioning issues. However, these studies used actual values for sleep quantity. Further studies using the deviation from an individuals own optimal sleep quantity may show us another aspect of the effects of sleep quantity on various life issues.

Measurements and Results: Subjective sleep was assessed via 2 weeks of daily sleep diaries (use of medication was covaried in all analyses); although there were no statistically significant group differences detected, all groups improved from baseline to posttreatment on subjective sleep efficiency (SE) and total wake time (TWT) and the effect sizes were large. Objective sleep was assessed via overnight polysomnographic monitoring at baseline and posttreatment; anal- yses revealed both CBT groups improved on TWT (p = .03), but the AD + SH group worsened. There was no statistically significant effect for PSG SE (p = .07). There was a between groups medium effect observed for the AD + SH and CBT + placebo group differences on diary TWT and both PSG variables.

Short sleep may increase daytime physical or psychological fatigue (Shen et al., 2006), promoting the onset of depression, which leads to biological cycle rhythm disorder or causes endocrine hormone changes (Germain and Kupfer, 2008; van Noorden et al., 2012; Luik et al., 2015). The bi-directional relationship between insomnia and depression has previously been established (Bao et al., 2017; Nutt et al., 2008). Furthermore, people who sleep for a long time still have a risk of depression, which may be correlated with low physical activity (Stranges et al., 2008). Decreased activity will reduce the level of neurotransmitters (especially dopamine and serotonin), the transmission of aminergic brain synapses (Weicker and Struder, 2001), and endorphin secretion (Janal et al., 1984), which will increase the risk of depression (Paluska and Schwenk, 2000). 4.4 Relationship between gender and depression Previous studies found that women are more likely to be affected by sleep duration, implying that gender could be another risk factor for depression (Wang et al., 2016). Women are more susceptible to the synergistic effect of hormones than men (such as estrogen) during most stages (viz. puberty, premenstrual period, postpartum period, and the transitional period of perimenopause), so they are prone to be exposed to depression (Janowsky and Rausch, 1985). Because only one study reported results for men and women separately, it is not enough to draw an accurate conclusion about the relationship between different genders and depression. Further research investigating the impact of sleep duration and depression on gender should be encouraged. 4.5 Strengths and limitations There were a few strengths in this work. First, our review, with a strict inclusion of eligible cohort studies, applied the RCS function to tting the potential non-linear relationship between sleep duration and the risk of depression.

The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan concluded that \"sleep quality is a superior sleep index to sleep quantity for assessing sleep\" (kohyama2021which, kohyama2021which_chunk_014).\n\n2. **Assessment Metrics**:\n   - Sleep quality can be evaluated using indices like the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which includes both sleep quantity and insomnia, while restfulness is considered a complementary measure (kohyama2021which, kohyama2021which_chunk_014). In contrast, sleep quantity is often simply measured by the total hours of sleep obtained.\n\n3. **Correlations and Findings**:\n   - Research indicates that there is a correlation between sleep quality and sleep quantity; however, they are not identical. For instance, Ramlee et al. identified total sleep quantity, the refreshed feeling upon waking, and the daytime mind state after sleep as the top three parameters determining sleep quality (kohyama2021which, kohyama2021which_chunk_014). Additionally, studies have shown that subjective sleep quality ratings do not strongly correlate with objective measures of sleep (kohyama2021which, kohyama2021which_chunk_014).\n\n4. **Age-Related Differences**:\n   - The need for sleep varies with age. Individuals aged 64 or less generally require a longer sleep duration, whereas those aged 65 or more may need a shorter time in bed (kohyama2021which, kohyama2021which_chunk_014).\n\n5. **Health Implications**:\n   - Poor sleep quality has been linked to various health issues, including psychiatric disorders and cardiovascular problems (kohyama2021which, kohyama2021which_chunk_001). For example, sleep disturbances have been shown to predict risks of hypertension and dyslipidemia (kohyama2021which, kohyama2021which_chunk_014).\n\nIn summary, while both sleep quantity and quality are crucial for overall health, sleep quality is often regarded as a more significant indicator of well-being than sleep quantity alone. The provided evidence does not contain information about specific statistics comparing the health outcomes of sleep quantity versus quality. To answer this question comprehensively, additional sources covering the direct health impacts of sleep quantity versus quality would be needed.", "chunks": [{"chunk_id": "kohyama2021which_chunk_014", "source_id": "kohyama2021which", "text": "ively.

Sleep quality is a superior sleep index to sleep quantity for assessing sleep; 2. Restfulness obtained through sleep is a useful index for assessing sleep quality; 3. Although PSQI and restfulness are correlated, these two indices are not identical; 4. PSQI includes sleep quantity and insomnia, while restfulness is complementary to either sleep duration, time in bed, or both; and 5. To obtain adequate sleep, people aged 64 or less need a longer sleep duration, whereas those aged 65 or more need a shorter time in bed. By means of a choice-based conjoint analysis, Ramlee et al. concluded that the top three parameters that determine sleep quality among 17 parameters were total sleep quantity, refreshed feeling upon waking, and the daytime mind state after sleep [64]. Although the study was carried out among older men, Faerman et al. [17] assessed the correlations between subjective sleep quality, determined by 5-point scales for sleep depth and restfulness in the morning, and actigraphic data, as well as heart rate, heart rate variability, and demographic and psychological variables. They found no correlation between the subjective and the objective measures. This result is consistent with a previous study by Kaplan and colleagues [18]. In 3173 men and women aged between 39 and 90, Kaplan et al. assessed the relationship between a morning rating of the prior nights sleep (sleep depth and restfulness) and polysomnographic and quantitative electroen- cephalographic descriptors of that single night of sleep. They concluded that objective data contribute little to explaining subjective sleep quality.

The PSQI is presumed not to be a perfect scale for measuring sleep quality. Several recent studies [1729] have used a simple question to assess sleep quality, and the details of this are introduced in a subsequent section. This review looks at both sleep quantity and sleep quality, considering how to manage the complex but probably unavoidable physiological phenomenon of sleep. Not enough data on these issues were obtained from children, however, this review tried to accumulate child data on both sleep quantity and sleep quality. 2. Sleep Quantity Sleep quantity decreases from about 18 to 16 h per day in the newborn infant to 7 to 6 h in older individuals. These age-related changes are well-known [30,31]. Although no Children 2021, 8, 542 3 of 13 one knows why these alterations occur and what factors determine them, several gures for the optimal sleep quantity at different ages have been recommended [3234]. Age is not the only determinant of sleep quantity. Sleep quantity is also markedly different among countries. In 17 predominantly Asian and predominantly Caucasian countries/regions [35], sleep quantity was investigated through an Internet survey among children aged from birth to 36 months. This study revealed that total sleep quantity ranged from 11.6 h (Japan) to 13.3 h (New Zealand). The differences seen in sleep quantity may be contributed to cultural differences. Screen time [36] and extracurricular after-school activities [37] have been identied as factors that contribute to the decrease in sleep quantity. Delayed bedtime was found to decrease the sleep quantity of 3-year-old children [38], and a long waiting time for a late meal may lead to decreased night-time sleep duration in preschoolers [39]. Quante et al. [37] divided the factors that reduce sleep quantity into intrinsic factors and extrinsic ones. In addition to the aforementioned factors, the intrinsic ones include the reduction of the accumulation of sleep pressure buil", "similarity_score": 0.5787043571472168}, {"chunk_id": "kohyama2021which_chunk_001", "source_id": "kohyama2021which", "text": "children Review Which Is More Important for Health: Sleep Quantity or Sleep Quality?

These declines were obvious in Asia (the mean change of minutes per year; 0.50), Canada (0.73), parts of Europe (0.92), and the USA (0.53), while sleep duration increased in Australia (+1.27), Scandinavia (+0.00) and the UK (+0.57) [6]. The sleep durations of preschoolers in Japan, especially nocturnal ones, reduced markedly over a period of nearly 70 years (between 19351936 and 2003) [7]. In both studies conducted in 19351936 and 2003, bedtime, waking time, and nap duration were asked through a direct interview to each mother. In 19351936, the average sleep duration of infants aged 611 months was 13.0 h, with a nocturnal sleep duration of 11.3 h, while in 2003 the average was 11.7 h with a nocturnal sleep duration of 10.1 h.

According to the Japan Society of School Health [8], the sleep duration of school pupils in Japan has recently been decreasing. From 1981 to 2016, sleep durations of grades 5 and 6 elementary school (ES) pupils decreased by 17 min in males and 24 min in females. Similarly, those of junior high school (JHS) pupils decreased 40 (male) and 38 (female) minutes.

Conclusions Both sleep quantity and sleep quality are fundamental components of sleep. Since there are marked inter-individual differences in the need for sleep, sleep quantity might be assessed not by actual duration but by a deviation from the individuals own optimal sleep quantity. For sleep quality, no standardized scale has been established, probably because sleep quality has many aspects. The variables for sleep quality can be selected depending on the purpose of the study. At present, many studies have decided that sleep quality, rather than sleep quantity, is favorable for reecting health or functioning issues. However, these studies used actual values for sleep quantity. Further studies using the deviation from an individuals own optimal sleep quantity may show us another aspect of the effects of sleep quantity on various life issues.
